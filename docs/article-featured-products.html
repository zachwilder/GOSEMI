            <h2>Advantest Expands 7038 System-Level Test Platform with Right-Sized Single Test Rack Solution</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">September 2025</p>

            <p>Advantest announced its 7038 Single Test Rack (STR) system-level test (SLT) and burn-in test (BI) solution. The 7038 STR extends the company's proven 7038 SLT platform with a lower-cost architecture optimized for slot-based automated test solutions, enabling right-sized SLT deployment in the production of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance compute (HPC), automotive, and other low- to mid-volume devices.</p>

            <p>The new 7038 STR delivers liquid-cooled thermal management of up to 1.4 kW per test site, enabling robust testing of today's most complex and power-hungry devices. With asynchronous test capability for up to 48 sites, the system offers a single-vendor turnkey solution that includes socket interface boards (SIBs), sockets, device multi-zone thermal management, software management and control, and an integrated automated handler.</p>

            <p>The 7038 STR is especially suited for mid- to low-volume production environments where customers require advanced SLT/BI capabilities without the higher investment and larger footprint of dual-rack systems.</p>

            <h2>Advantest Unveils MTe – Unified, Scalable Test Platform for Power Semiconductor Devices</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">October 2025</p>

            <p>Advantest announced the MTe power test platform. The cutting-edge MTe redefines test efficiency and scalability to address test requirements for the fast-growing power semiconductor market. Increasing market demand for electrification across automotive, industrial, renewable energy, telecommunication and data infrastructure applications is pushing semiconductor manufacturers to achieve higher performance and lower cost of test (CoT).</p>

            <p>The MTe platform responds to these needs by combining modular hardware architecture, ultimate system scalability and advanced digital control, redefining the standard in power semiconductor test performance and efficiency. Designed with state-of-the-art Advantest technology, MTe provides significant footprint reduction and optimized resource distribution without performance degradation.</p>

            <p>The MTe platform is able to address emerging wide-bandgap semiconductor (e.g., SiC and GaN) challenges, as well as the integration of digital IP cores on power devices (e.g., IPM and IPD), providing high bandwidth capture, best-in-class gate driver control, dynamic (and short-circuit) test up to 10kA, and flexible high-voltage digital capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Advantest Introduces Next-Generation M5241 Memory Handler</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">December 2025</p>

            <p>Advantest announced the M5241 Memory Handler, its next-generation handler developed to meet the performance, automation, and cost-efficiency demands of emerging high-performance memory devices—particularly those used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. First shipments of the new handler are scheduled for Q2 of calendar year 2026.</p>

            <p>Engineered as the next evolution of Advantest's memory test cell strategy, the M5241 utilizes vertical docking to integrate seamlessly with the company's latest T5801 ultra-high-speed DRAM tester and offers docking compatibility with existing testers, including the T5833, T5503HS2, and T5835, enabling customers to fully leverage their installed base.</p>

            <p>The handler's new temperature-control architecture—combined with optional active thermal control—delivers accurate, stable testing for advanced memory ICs, including those with significant self-heating, directly improving yield and reliability for customers' devices.</p>

            <h2>Advantest Unveils T2000 AiR2X Air-Cooled SoC and Power Analog Test Solution</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">December 2025</p>

            <p>Advantest announced the T2000 AiR2X, a next-generation air-cooled test system engineered to meet rising demand for compact, cost-efficient testers in evaluation and high-mix, low-volume production environments. The new solution is fully compatible with the conventional T2000 test system and delivers twice the test resources of the previous air-cooled T2000 AiR test system, while maintaining low power and air-cooling requirements.</p>

            <p>With its flexible measurement configuration, the T2000 AiR2X supports up to 12 measurement modules, including functional/SCAN test, high-precision DC and automotive device DC testing up to 320V. The system's unique multisite controller function significantly reduces test time during volume production.</p>

            <p>Initial device evaluations are underway, confirming broad application coverage for the T2000 AiR2X across industrial MCUs, consumer ASICs, battery-monitoring ICs for automotive and mobile devices, and power analog applications.</p>
