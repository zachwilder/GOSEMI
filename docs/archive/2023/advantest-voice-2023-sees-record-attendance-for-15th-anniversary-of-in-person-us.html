            <p>Advantest concluded its VOICE 2023 user conference at the Santa Clara Marriott in Santa Clara, California, with a record-high turnout of nearly 400 attendees – a 25% increase from 2022 – the majority of whom were Advantest customers and industry partners. This year’s event, held on May 8-10, marked the 15th anniversary of the in-person VOICE conference, attracting participants representing more than 50 companies from around the globe. Over two days, a total of 71 papers were presented across nine technical tracks, of which 40% were written or co-authored by Advantest’s customers and industry partners. In commemoration of the 15th anniversary, past VOICE chairpersons were invited on stage at the opening of the General Session to celebrate all the conference has accomplished to date.</p>
<p>VOICE 2023 received over 140 abstract submissions from 25 companies across 10 countries. The technical tracks for this year’s event covered a range of topics important to the ATE industry, such as 5G/millimeter wave, AI/ML, high-performance computing, parametric test, data innovation and analytics, cloud technologies, and device/system-level test, to name a few.</p>
<p>In addition to technical sessions, VOICE 2023 offered a Partner’s Expo where Advantest’s industry partners met with attendees to showcase their latest products and services. This year’s keynote line-up featured such notable speakers as Dex Hunter-Torricke, head of global communications and marketing, Deepmind; Dr. Gaurav Gupta, VP analyst, emerging technologies and trends, Gartner; Claudionor Coelho, chief AI officer and senior VP of engineering, Advantest; and Michael Campbell, VP of engineering at Qualcomm Technologies.</p>
