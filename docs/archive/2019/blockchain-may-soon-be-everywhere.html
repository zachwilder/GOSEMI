            <p>By Judy Davies, Vice President of Global Marketing
Communications, Advantest</p>
<p>Just as disruptive integrated circuit (IC)
technologies have been invented, evolved, tested and secured adoption for
widespread use, the same is true for innovative applications – such as
blockchain. Conceived in 2008, blockchain is gaining momentum as a means of
enabling the secure distribution of data for digital transactions. The
technology, which has its roots in cryptocurrency, is appealing to businesses
for two key attributes: it serves as a decentralized ledger, and it protects
any entered data from being modified. Because it can be used to record
transactions between parties efficiently, permanently and verifiably, the
technology may become a key asset in combatting identity theft and online
fraud.</p>
<p>Blockchain has the potential to streamline
and safeguard digital business operations for companies of all sizes, from large chains to small online
startups. In one of its more unique applications,
blockchain is being used to certify the authenticity and history of <a href="https://www.powersystemsdesign.com/articles/using­blockchain-technology-to-verify-naturaI-diamonds/8/14092">natural
diamonds</a>, enabling buyers to
distinguish the real thing from synthetic gems and fake stones. This
could prove hugely valuable in helping eliminate support of blood diamonds or
ensuring an engagement ring’s gems are the real thing.</p>
<p>Another application is a blockchain ledger,
which can extend “smart” connected technology beyond phones, appliances and
cars to include stock certificates, property deeds, insurance policies and
other important documents. By maintaining the papers’ current
ownership records, blockchain can become, in
essence, a “smart key,” allows access to the permitted person(s) alone.
Government, health care, finance and other fields that rely on unbreachable
documentation could be transformed by this capability.</p>
<p>Verifying the path from farm to table to
help <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennysplitter/2018/09/30/what-can-blockchain-really-do-for-the-food-industry/#183c23d0488e">ensure
food safety</a> is another
potential use for blockchain. For
example, by keeping a registry of the specific
field or section from which a head of lettuce was harvested, blockchain
may help to quickly pinpoint the sources of dangerously tainted foodstuffs. This
will keep consumers safer from illness, as well as prevent unnecessary disposal
of uncontaminated food. And if you sometimes wonder whether your produce really
is organic or your turkey free-range, this technology can assure you of your
food’s integrity.</p>
<p>While hacking is a fear with any networked
technology, blockchain may actually prove to be the most impervious to being
hacked. Instead of utilizing a central data storehouse, all information on a blockchain is decentralized, encrypted and cross-checked by the entire network. With this distributed design, there is no third-party data center
for transactions. Each user’s computer, or node, has a complete copy of the
ledger, so even if one or two nodes is lost, system-wide data loss is not a
risk. Moreover, using encryption means that file signatures can be verified
across all ledgers, on all networked nodes, to ensure they haven’t been
altered. If any unauthorized change is made, the traced signature is invalidated.</p>
<p>Blockchain’s
design also allows data tracking with validity that can be easily confirmed.
Its transparency offers a welcome alternative to the way that much of our
personal, online information has been dissected and manipulated for financial
gain by some well-known technology behemoths. With its nearly unlimited breadth
of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/whats-in-a-blockchain-with-these-new-tools-anyone-can-find-out">applications</a>, blockchain technology looks well-positioned to make the
leap from managing digital currencies to becoming the next-generation solution
for our online personal and work lives.</p>
