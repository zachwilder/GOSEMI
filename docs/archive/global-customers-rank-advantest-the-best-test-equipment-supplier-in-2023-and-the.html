            <p><em>By GO SEMI &amp; Beyond Staff</em></p>
<p>Advantest has again topped the ratings chart of the 2023 TechInsights (formerly VLSIresearch) <em>Customer Satisfaction Survey</em>, capturing the No. 1 spot on this prestigious annual survey of global semiconductor companies for the fourth consecutive year. The company has now been named to the 10 BEST list for each of the 35 years that the survey has been in existence. The survey ratings are based on direct customer feedback representing more than 60% of the world’s chip producers, which include integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), fabless companies, and outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) providers.</p>
<p>According to TechInsights, Advantest, THE BEST supplier of test equipment in 2020, 2021 and 2022, was again the leading test equipment supplier in 2023. The company also RANKED 1st in the 10 BEST list of large suppliers of chip making equipment for the fourth consecutive year. Advantest achieved superior customer ratings in the areas of <em>Partnering</em>, <em>Recommended Supplier,</em> <em>Trust in Supplier</em>, <em>Technical Leadership, </em>and <em>Commitment. </em>According to TechInsights, Advantest continually ranks high among THE BEST Suppliers of Test Equipment and, in 2023, was once again the only ATE supplier to receive a Five-Star designation.</p>
<p>The TechInsights annual Customer Satisfaction Survey is the only publicly available opportunity since 1988 for customers to provide feedback on suppliers of semiconductor equipment and subsystems. Worldwide participants rated equipment suppliers among 14 categories based on three key factors: supplier performance, customer service, and product performance. The categories span a set of criteria, including cost of ownership, quality of results, field engineering support, trust, and partnership.</p>
<p>“Advantest continues to set new industry standards for product development and customer service, prioritizing its customers’ needs and supporting their success,” stated G. Dan Hutcheson, Vice Chair of TechInsights. “Through its broad product portfolio and expansive global network, Advantest enables its customers to create groundbreaking innovations that drive the semiconductor industry forward. Year after year, Advantest earns the highest ratings from the world’s global manufacturers and has topped the ratings charts once again.” </p>
<p>“We are honored to be recognized in such high regard by our global customers and grateful to know that our partnering efforts are valued,” said Yoshiaki Yoshida, Advantest Corporation president and CEO. “As semiconductors become increasingly essential to our society, we will continue to deliver the leading-edge test solutions our customers have come to expect from us while driving innovation forward with sustainable products that meet not only their needs but those of the environment.”  </p>
<p>As a global provider of test solutions for SoC, logic and memory semiconductors, Advantest has long been the industry’s only ATE supplier to design and manufacture its own fully integrated suite of test-cell solutions comprising testers, handlers, device interfaces, and software – assuring the industry’s highest levels of integrity and compatibility.<img alt="" src="../images/archive/global-customers-rank-advantest-the-best-test-equipment-supplier-in-2023-and-the-1.png" /></p>
