<p>VOICE, the annual developer conference hosted by Advantest Corporation, will kick off its second decade on May 16-17 at the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells Resort &amp; Spa in Palm Springs, Calif. The conference will again be held in dual locations, with the U.S. event being followed by VOICE China on May 26, at the Intercontinental Shanghai Pudong in Shanghai.</p>
<p>With a record number of technical presentations, an expanded Technology Kiosk Showcase, and a new technology track, this year’s program is shaping up to be the most exciting yet. The dual-venue VOICE 2017 <a href="https://voice.advantest.com/agenda/">agenda</a> includes three diverse keynote speakers, a Partners’ Expo, and interactive discussion sessions for users of the V93000 and T2000 system-on-chip (SoC) test platforms, as well as Advantest test cell solutions.</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="https://voice.advantest.com/technical-program/">technical program</a> features a roster of papers from Advantest’s worldwide customers, partners and employees, all presenting insights and best practices. Technical topics will cover device-specific testing, hardware design and integration, improving throughput, reducing time-to-market, new hardware/software test solutions, test methodologies, product engineering, hot topics in the ATE industry, and — for the first time – SmarTEST 8.0 for the V93000 platform. At both events, additional topics will be spotlighted in technical kiosks staffed by Advantest R&amp;D, industry experts and technologists. The kiosks at VOICE China are expected to reach record numbers this year.</p>
<p>In addition to the rich technical content, VOICE 2017 features exciting keynote speeches each morning. The Palm Springs event will get underway with a talk by Advantest’s own Hans-Juergen Wagner, senior vice president of the SoC product group. His presentation, “The Future Trends for and Contributions of Test in the SoC Market,” will detail the drivers, challenges and emerging trends of SoC device designs and their impact on test. The second day’s keynote speaker will be former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent Chris Tarbell, one of the Bureau’s most successful cyber security law enforcement officials of all time. His must-attend presentation sheds light on information too sensitive for print. In Shanghai, Dr. Peter Chen, senior director of China business development at TSMC China Company Limited, will share his insights into the global semiconductor industry landscape, technology trends, and especially the ecosystem and market in China.</p>
<p>Opportunities for face-to-face interaction will be available at various networking activities, including a don’t-miss evening event in the Enchanted Desert near the San Andreas Fault Line in Palm Springs. In addition, a Partners’ Expo will be held in both Palm Springs and China for sponsors to showcase their advanced solutions related to semiconductor testing.</p>
<p>To register for the U.S. event, go to <a href="https://voice.advantest.com/register">https://voice.advantest.com/register</a>. Online registration closes May 11. On-site registration is available at an increased fee.</p>
<p>Those interested in attending the VOICE China event should email <a href="mailto:mktgcomms@advantest.com">mktgcomms@advantest.com</a> for more information. The presentations in China will be in Mandarin Chinese.</p>
