<p><em>The use of artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning is growing as the semiconductor
industry discovers new ways to use these approaches to do things that humans cannot.
In this issue, we talk with Keith Schaub, Vice President of Business
Development for Advantest America’s Applied Research Technology and Ventures,
about unique research Advantest is conducting with the Univ. of Texas, Dallas,
to integrate machine learning into a challenging area of chip development: RF
transceiver design, test and manufacturing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q. What led Advantest
to begin investigating the use of machine learning for this application?</strong></p>
<p>A.
Machine learning has been around for a long time. It’s actually a subset of AI,
by which machines learn how to complete tasks without being explicitly
programmed to do so. There have been many startups over the years that looked
to leverage machine learning, but it’s never really been implemented previously
within the semiconductor industry. As we have begun to do more work looking at
the potential advantages of using AI, we’ve come to realize there are some
practical applications by which the industry could greatly benefit.</p>
<p>**Q. What is the approach
you’re developing for implementing machine learning? **</p>
<p>A.
The approach we’ve been working on with UT Dallas is a proof of concept for how
to take a machine learning method and apply it to semiconductor manufacturing
and test – specifically, RF transceivers. Machine learning is much better
suited to analog than to digital devices. Digital is a series of 1s and 0s, so
the system can either recognize something or not, but there’s no ability to drill
down in terms of granularity in order to leverage the more powerful aspects of
machine learning. Analog systems require far more data because they’re more
complex, making them a better environment for machine learning. </p>
<p>In
RF applications, the numerous transmission protocols, large amounts of data,
and large bandwidths with high data rates create challenges that call for the development
of new algorithms for which modern machine learning is well suited. RF
transceivers are affected by a variety of impairments, such as compression,
interference and offset errors, as well as IQ imbalance. IQ signals form the
basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in
software, as well as in complex signal analysis.</p>
<p>Figure
1 shows a typical RF transceiver circuit, with a number of potential noise
errors highlighted in red. A graphical representation of the signal quality can
be generated to correspond with each error (Figure 2). The challenge for the
operator is knowing which error generated which plot, and which errors are the
most problematic.</p>
<p>The
approach we’ve developed is a machine learning-based solution for noise
classification and decomposition in RF transceivers. The machine learning system can be trained to learn and then
identify and match up each impairment to each noise plot; this is something
that would be virtually impossible for a human to do.</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. RF circuit
with potential noise errors in red.</em></p>
<p><em>Figure 2.

errors.</em></p>
<p>**Q. How would this be
put to use in a manufacturing environment? **</p>
<p>A.
 Figure 3 illustrates how the machine
learning solution works. During the training process – this is literally how
the system learns to recognize and classify data – a set of constellation
points from early versions of the ICs being developed are fed into a machine
learning system. Extracted features are separated by category as either
noise-type classification or noise-level regression, with the system learning
what each type is and how to separate and recognize them by individual error.
This is indicated by the different colors assigned to each specific noise type.
This is particularly valuable because, while RF transceiver designs, like those
of most analog circuits, involve a high degree of customization, certain types
of noise errors can potentially occur regardless of the specific circuit.</p>
<p>Once
the training process is complete, the system can be put into use in production
mode with actual DUTs [devices under test], and use what it has learned through
the training process to apply models, identify the various types of errors and
provide an impairment report. The system doesn’t have to go through lengthy
downtime because the assessment can be completed quickly, and the resulting
report allows the user to determine which errors are most critical and need to
be addressed so that no damage or yield loss occurs.</p>
<p><em>Figure 3. Machine learning
process for RF transceiver noise classification and decomposition.</em></p>
<p>This approach can be used throughout
the test process – not only for device and system-level test, but also during design-for-test,
so that analog/RF designers can better simulate and understand whether their
designs will work. This is important due to amount of hand/custom work and the number
of variables associated with analog device design.</p>
<p><strong>Q. At what point do
you see this technique being broadly adopted in the industry? What challenges
would prevent this from occurring?</strong></p>
<p>A. While the technology is mature enough
that it could be implemented right away, there are several reasons machine
learning has not yet been broadly adopted in the semiconductor industry. For
one, there haven’t been sufficient resources/datasets to support its widespread
use. For another, the industry is highly risk averse and concerned about
security, so companies don’t want to make their data – which is their valuable IP
– available for the machine learning process. They have it in the cloud, but in
their own individual clouds, which don’t talk to each other. My belief is that
use of machine learning will become widespread when the big IDMs [integrated
device manufacturers] take the initiative, and the rest of the industry will
follow suit.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>Advantest’s Applied Research Technology and Ventures group would like to acknowledge the recent publication at the 2019 IEEE 37th VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) of a paper titled “Machine Learning-based Noise Classification and Decomposition in RF Transceivers,” which details the work described in this interview. The paper was jointly developed by Deepika Neethirajan, Constantinos Xanthopoulos, Kiruba Subramani, Yiorgos Makris (UT Dallas), Keith Schaub and Ira Leventhal (Advantest America).<img alt="" src="../images/archive/qa-interview-with-keith-schaub-1.png" /></p>
