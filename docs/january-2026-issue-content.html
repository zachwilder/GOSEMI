<p><strong>Singulated Die Test Ensures Stacked Die Quality as Power Density
Rises</strong></p>
<p><em>Editor's note: This article is based on the poster "The Age of
Singulated Die Test" presented at the Test Vision Symposium held in
conjunction with SEMICON West, October 7-9, 2025, Phoenix, AZ.</em></p>
<p><em>By Brent Bullock, Advantest America</em></p>
<p>The accelerating rate at which the industry adopts new process nodes is
posing critical test challenges. Shrinking geometries combined with
increased design complexity with respect to metrics such as gates per
square micrometer, plus higher operating frequencies, are leading to
ever higher levels of power density. The resulting device thermal
excursions are driving the need for singulated die test (SDT) with
active thermal control (ATC), which combine to boost yields and ensure
the quality of the chiplets and other die that make up multichip
packages for high-performance computing (HPC) and
artificial-intelligence (AI) server farms.</p>
<p>SDT detects defects that do not appear until after singulation, which
are most often faults in chip-to-chip interconnects. SDT can also
improve device handling efficiency, so it is applicable to multiple test
scenarios, with test content varying accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Die-probe insertion using Final-Test conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Die matching and die-bank rescreening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complex chip-on-wafer/ known-good assembly testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extended yield learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silicon-photonics optical-engine testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power-density growth</strong></p>
<p>Figure 1 shows an estimate of power density's dramatic growth in the
HPC/AI era.</p>
<p><figure><img alt="A graph with a line and dots AI-generated content may be
incorrect." src="images/issues/january-2026/image1.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1. Power density has accelerated throughout the HPC/AI era.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The high power density in turn produces large thermal gradients, with
the low to max temperature changes increasing dramatically in both
mission mode and test mode as process geometries shrink, as shown in
Figure 2. These large temperature gradients lead to increased yield loss
due to challenges in maintaining the set temperature.</p>
<p><figure><img alt="A graph with red lines AI-generated content may be
incorrect." src="images/issues/january-2026/image2.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2. Temperature excursions</figcaption></figure> <em>(∆Temp) increase as process
technology shrinks.</em></p>
<p>Consequently, Advantest customers are taking steps to monitor and
control the thermal gradients and respond to the temperature excursions
from the wafer-sort level through final test.</p>
<p>However, the ability to control thermal behavior during various test
insertions has been problematic, requiring close attention to the
thermal interfaces and differing thermal masses. Thermal control at
wafer sort traditionally has been very limited, because a single large
chuck, historically with just a single sensor in the middle of it,
provides temperature control. Subsequent chuck configurations included
multiple sensors in multiple zones, approaches that did provide some
relief and drove yield improvements. Package test also presents
challenges, because the package itself, potentially with a lid, adds
thermal mass. So many customers feel they need to move to more
aggressive thermal-control solutions at die sort.</p>
<p><strong>Die-probe insertion</strong></p>
<p>Die-probe insertion offers one solution, with thermal control required
for only a small piece of the wafer---the singulated die---allowing
thermal interfacing directly without a lid, so the thermal mass is very
low and the thermal characteristics very different. With the arrival of
high-power-density devices, SDT, which has existed since about 2015 but
has found limited adoption, is now gaining interest.</p>
<p>SDT allows customers to respond to temperature changes very quickly, and
Advantest has been involved in studies in this area. In particular,
customers have CoWoS and similar advanced package assemblies, and many
defects in such structures do not appear until after the singulation
process, which applies mechanical stress to each die. Furthermore,
temperature stresses for singulated dies can be greater because each
singulated chip cannot rely on the mass of the entire wafer, which
provides mechanical strength and thermal dissipation. The combination of
mechanical and thermal stresses increases the chances of faults at the
die-to-die interconnects, whether in CoWoS assemblies or HBM stacks. The
latter continues to present yield challenges as stack heights continue
to grow.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to singulated die test. The main focus is on
temperature response---the ability to regulate thermal excursions during
a wafer-sort insertion by mimicking the final-test conditions. Some
Advantest customers have a discrepancy between final-test temperature
and wafer-sort temperature set points because the wafer-probe
environment has been more challenging. The singulated die probe allows
better control to mitigate the thermal excursions and probe burn risk
that are more common with typical chuck-based probe insertions. With the
rise of chiplet technology and stacked-die use, it is increasingly
likely that good dies can be mixed with bad dies, resulting in good
dies, substrates, and interposers being discarded.</p>
<p>SDT can also accelerate product release cycles, speeding time to market.
With traditional wafer probing, a few bad dies can hold up a complete
wafer as engineers study yield problems and determine how to fix them.
With SDT, bad dies can be held back for study, but good dies can
immediately proceed on to packaging and final test and on to customers.</p>
<p>Traditional wafer probing is also subject to probe-burn concerns that
arise when touching down on multiple dies, especially in the early
phases of a new design or process node. SDT can also avoid the silicon
defectivity problems that compromise multi-site probe test efficiency by
matching probably good die.</p>
<p><strong>Die-level handler</strong></p>
<p>Equipment that can address the challenges of singulated die test
includes the Advantest HA1200 die-level handler, which, when equipped
with an active thermal interface (ATI), can be used in conjunction with
test systems such as the Advantest V93000 SoC tester. The combination
can enable the test of high-end SoCs with excellent test coverage,
helping to reduce yield loss at the final test of multi-die assembled
products. Figure 3 shows the HA1200 (left) and a 100-W/cm<sup>2</sup> quad-site
active thermal interface for testing CPU chiplet dies. When used with
the V93000, which sits on top of the HA1200's die alignment unit
(right-side module below), the handler and thermal interface can obtain
a thermal profile to enable comparison with the thermal profiles at
wafer sort and at final test.</p>
<p><img alt="A large machine with a rectangular top AI-generated content may be
incorrect." src="images/issues/january-2026/image3.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. An Advantest study employed an HA1200 handler (left) and a
100-W/cm<sup>2</sup> quad-site active thermal interface (right).</em></p>
<p>A specific study conducted by Advantest included an analog-to-digital
converter attached to the probe load board to capture profiles of device
current, voltage, and junction temperature; an HA1200 die-level handler
configured with two generations of the company's ATI thermal solution;
and a V93000 tester programmed to test a 6-nm CPU chiplet die.</p>
<p>The study involved manual execution of a single test-site V93000 test
flow on a quad-site die-probe setup using a hot temperature setpoint,
and it compared the temperature profiles of a hot-temperature wafer-sort
insertion, a hot-temperature package-test insertion, and two
hot-temperature SDT insertion. Figure 4 shows the peak temperature
excursion and the time to guardband for the wafer-sort hot test, two
test setups for the SDT hot test (Thermal setup #1 with the Gen 1 ATI
solution and Thermal setup #2 with the Gen 2 version), and the final
package test hot test.</p>
<p><figure><img alt="" src="images/issues/january-2026/image4.emf" /><figcaption>Figure 4. The Advantest study recorded peak temperature excursion and
the time to guardband for the wafer-sort (WS) hot test, two test setups
for the SDT hot test, and the final-test (FT) hot test.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>Further work</strong></p>
<p>Work remains to be done on effectively implementing SDT. For example,
customers are very interested in applying SDT to achieve SoCoW-assembly
quality improvements. Also of interest are new, larger Advantest thermal
interfaces that can dissipate more heat. Work needs to be done
evaluating these interfaces based on customer data, as power density
increases with future process nodes. In addition, work is proceeding on
multisite efficiency gains and quad-site thermal evaluation, as well as
on studying post-singulation yield and defectivity.</p>
<p>Finally, customers are evaluating when and for what devices SDT is most
effective. Most customers are expected to continue with the Wafer Sort 1
cold test, but they could consider replacing the Wafer Sort 2
chuck-based test with SDT, allowing closer tuning with final-test
results. These customers must evaluate trade-offs between yield gains
and disruption to their standard test processes and the capital
investment involved. Considerations will include factors such as total
test time and the average selling price of the device under test. For
many customers producing singulated chip on wafer structures, SDT will
very likely pay for itself.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Advantest's HA1200 handler equipped with ATC has demonstrated the
ability to precisely regulate temperatures, allowing a singulated die
test to simulate final-test conditions. An Advantest study has
demonstrated that SDT is effective in controlling temperatures as
process geometries shrink and power densities rise for HPC and AI
devices with HBM stacks and CoWoS structures.</p>

Optimization</strong></p>

Manufacturing</a> magazine. You can read the

<p>By Vincent Chu, Sr. Consulting Manager, <em>Advantest Cloud Solutions</em></p>
<p>As semiconductor devices become increasingly complex, the challenge of
testing them efficiently and accurately grows in parallel. Traditional
testing methods---rooted in static test plans---often fall short in
dealing with the nuances of today's advanced integrated circuits (ICs),
especially in high-volume manufacturing environments.</p>
<p>In response, the industry is exploring real-time, data-driven strategies
powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Among
the most promising approaches is the use of <strong>digital twins</strong>---virtual
replicas of production systems---to develop, test, and deploy AI/ML
models that can dynamically optimize semiconductor testing processes.</p>
<p>This article outlines a digital twin framework developed to support
AI/ML-enabled semiconductor test optimization. It describes the system's
architecture, its integration with real-world and virtual environments,
and how it supports a complete AI/ML lifecycle---from development to
deployment and monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>The Testing Bottleneck</strong></p>
<p>IC testing plays a crucial role in guaranteeing product reliability
across sectors like automotive, consumer electronics, and
telecommunications. However, as devices become more
heterogeneous---integrating multiple technologies in a single
package---static, one-size-fits-all test approaches no longer suffice.</p>
<p>These legacy methods often result in excessive test time, missed
defects, or yield loss due to overly conservative test limits. The
inability to adapt in real-time to device variability creates
inefficiencies that can ripple across entire production lines,
increasing costs and time-to-market.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>AI/ML-driven adaptive testing</strong> comes in. By analyzing
test data as it\'s generated, AI models can infer outcomes, flag
anomalies, and dynamically alter test sequences. For example, if
early-stage test results confidently predict a device\'s performance,
tests can be optimized, saving time and resources. Conversely, AI can
flag devices that may require additional scrutiny, focusing effort where
it matters most.</p>

insertions to reduce test time</p>
<p><strong>Digital Twin Framework: Overview</strong></p>
<p>The proposed solution combines a <strong>real-time production environment</strong>
with a <strong>cloud-based digital twin</strong>, creating a unified platform for
intelligent test optimization. The digital twin serves as a sandbox for
developing and validating AI/ML models, while the production environment
enables real-time deployment and monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Key Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Production Environment:</strong> Includes Advantest's V93000 testers, ACS
    Edge Servers, and ACS Unified Servers. Real-time test data is
    collected and processed through the ACS Real-Time Data
    Infrastructure (RTDI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Twin Environment:</strong> Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS),
    this mirrors the production environment virtually using VMs that
    simulate testers and edge computing platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Synchronization:</strong> Achieved via AWS IoT using Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, enabling secure, low-latency
    bidirectional communication between production and digital twin
    environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI/ML Workflow:</strong> Supports the complete lifecycle---development,
    validation, deployment, monitoring, and updating of models---all
    orchestrated through this synchronized ecosystem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Production Environment Architecture</strong></p>
<p>The production environment is designed to execute AI/ML-powered test
optimization in real time. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>V93000 Tester with ACS Nexus™ Software:</strong> A widely used test
    platform for System-on-Chip (SoC) devices. Nexus provides data
    streaming and test control capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACS Edge Server™:</strong> Performs AI/ML inference at the edge with
    millisecond latency. Deployed models interact directly with live
    test data through secure, high-speed connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ACS Unified Server™:</strong> Acts as a central repository for
    containerized applications and historical data, also enabling
    feed-forward use cases where earlier test results inform later
    stages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This tightly integrated setup allows dynamic test adjustments, reducing
overall test time and improving yield without sacrificing reliability.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Diagram of production environment</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Testing with the Digital Twin</strong></p>
<p>In parallel, a <strong>digital twin environment</strong> replicates the production
setup on AWS, offering a safe, scalable space for innovation.</p>
<p>This virtual lab uses cloud-hosted VMs to mimic the tester host
controller, Edge Server, and Unified Server. Engineers can simulate
real-time testing by replaying historical data, allowing them to train,
test, and fine-tune AI/ML models without interfering with ongoing
production.</p>
<p>A web-based UI provides remote access and management, making
collaboration possible regardless of location.</p>

<p>Fig. 3. Diagram of digital twin environment</p>
<p><strong>Synchronizing Real and Virtual Worlds</strong></p>
<p>For the framework to function effectively, the real and virtual
environments must be tightly synchronized. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Transfer (Offline and Real-Time):</strong> In early stages,
    historical test data is transferred manually using SFTP and stored
    in AWS S3. Once deployed, real-time synchronization uses <strong>AWS IoT
    and MQTT</strong>, with topics categorizing both test results and control
    actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MQTT Topics:</strong> For example, test data from a leakage test might be
    published under /v93000/tester_A/test_results/leakage, while
    deployment commands use /action/edge_server_B/deploy/model_ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> All communications are encrypted with Transport Layer
    Security (TLS), aligning with zero-trust principles and protecting
    sensitive test data during transfer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI/ML Lifecycle: From Concept to Deployment</strong></p>
<p>The framework supports a structured AI/ML workflow designed for high
agility and minimal disruption to production.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Development</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Models are developed in the digital twin using historical or synthetic
test data. Standard Test Data Format (STDF) files stored in AWS S3 can
be used to simulate real-time streams to virtual ACS Edge Servers,
allowing algorithm experimentation in a production-like context.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

<p>Fig. 5. Development</p>
<p><strong>2. Validation</strong></p>
<p>Before deployment, models undergo statistical validation using
techniques like cross-validation or hold-out testing. Engineers can run
simulations combining the virtual tester and Edge Server to understand
real-world impacts on yield and quality.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

<p>Fig. 6. Validation</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Deployment is managed through <strong>AWS IoT Jobs</strong>, which automates
container delivery. Models are packaged into containers, pushed to the
digital twin Unified Server, and then replicated to production Unified
Servers and deployed to Edge Servers.</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect." src="images/issues/january-2026/image11.png" /></p>
<p>Fig. 7. Deployment</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Once live, the digital twin tracks model performance using MQTT data
feeds. KPIs such as prediction accuracy, false positive rates, and
statistical drift are monitored to assess effectiveness.</p>
<p><img alt="A computer screen shot of a remote control AI-generated content may be
incorrect." src="images/issues/january-2026/image12.png" /></p>
<p>Fig. 8. Monitoring</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Updating/Redeployment</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If performance degrades, new models are trained and validated in the
digital twin, then redeployed. This update process is designed to avoid
interfering with ongoing testing, supporting continuous optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Insights and Use Case</strong></p>
<p>To validate the framework, a prototype was implemented using Advantest's
ACS Gemini platform. A simulated production environment was created
using VMs and historical test data to represent a common AI/ML use case:
<strong>Dynamic Part Average Testing (DPAT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Using pseudo-models, the team demonstrated how adaptive testing logic
could be applied in near real-time, reducing test time while maintaining
defect coverage. The test sequence and model deployments were
coordinated through AWS IoT Jobs and MQTT messaging, proving that the
system could operate under conditions resembling real-world factory
environments.</p>
<p><strong>Key Benefits:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Production-Grade Simulation</strong></p>
<p>The digital twin allows model development and debugging under realistic
conditions, eliminating the need to disrupt live production lines.</p>
<p><strong>Agile Deployment</strong></p>
<p>AWS IoT and containerization enable remote model deployment in seconds,
streamlining the go-live process.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong></p>
<p>Real-time monitoring and bidirectional data flows make it easy to
identify underperforming models and roll out updates with minimal
downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>AWS cloud resources can be scaled on demand to handle increasing data
volumes, enabling the framework to grow with evolving manufacturing
needs.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Cloud-based access encourages cross-disciplinary teamwork among
engineers, data scientists, and developers regardless of physical
location.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions</strong></p>
<p>The framework's flexibility opens doors for further enhancements:</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Data for Robust Training</strong></p>
<p>To accelerate model development, synthetic data generation will be
incorporated. This allows testing for rare or extreme scenarios---such
as silicon defects or process drift---without waiting for real-world
failures to occur.</p>
<p><strong>SEMI RITdb Integration</strong></p>
<p>Planned adoption of the <strong>SEMI E183 RITdb standard</strong>, which supports
MQTT-based real-time data streaming, will improve compatibility with
other smart manufacturing systems. This standardization facilitates
broader data interoperability across test platforms and factory
automation systems.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As semiconductor devices push the limits of complexity and scale,
traditional testing strategies are no longer sufficient. The integration
of digital twin technology with real-time AI/ML offers a promising path
forward, enabling adaptive, intelligent, and efficient testing
methodologies.</p>
<p>This digital twin framework showcases how cloud-based virtualization,
real-time data synchronization, and scalable AI/ML deployment can
modernize the semiconductor testing landscape. By bridging the gap
between development and production, it paves the way for smarter
manufacturing and faster innovation---exactly what the industry needs in
an era of relentless progress.</p>

engineering teams face mounting pressure to accelerate development
cycles while maintaining uncompromising quality. Advantest's
<strong>SiConic™</strong> is a game-changing software platform, bridging design
verification and silicon validation, redefining how engineers interact
with silicon across the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>A Paradigm Shift in Validation</strong></p>
<p>SiConic enables seamless reuse of test content from simulation
environments to actual silicon. This shift eliminates the traditional
bottlenecks of simulation loops and conversions, allowing engineers to
execute native test cases directly on silicon. The result? A dramatic
reduction in debug cycle times---up to <strong>75% faster</strong>---and a more
deterministic path to a reliable sign-off.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Collaboration Across Domains</strong></p>
<p>SiConic is more than a toolset---it's a <strong>collaborative platform</strong> that
empowers DV, SV, DFT, and test engineering teams to work within a
unified environment. This cross-domain synergy is essential in today's
semiconductor development cycle, where time-to-market pressures and
design complexity are at an all-time high.</p>
<p>By enabling engineers to debug and validate test content rapidly,
SiConic frees up valuable engineering capacity to put the focus back on
innovation through efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>EDA Partnerships: Enabling SiConic</strong></p>
<p>SiConic leads with strong partnerships, including <strong>Cadence</strong>,
<strong>Siemens</strong>, and <strong>Synopsys</strong>---three of the most influential players in
the semiconductor design ecosystem. These collaborations ensure that
SiConic integrates smoothly with widely adopted verification and
validation workflows, allowing teams to reuse test content across
simulation and silicon with minimal friction.</p>
<p>By aligning with these partners, SiConic supports a broad range of tool
chains and methodologies, making it easier for engineering teams to
adopt the platform without disrupting existing processes. This
interoperability not only accelerates bring-up and debug cycles but also

<p><strong>AI Looms Large As Test Applications Continue to Broaden</strong></p>
<p><em>This article is adapted with permission from <a href="https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/">Semiconductor Digest
Magazine</a> as part of their 2026
Outlook series. You can find the original article</em> <em>here.</em></p>
<p>By Doug Lefever, Representative Director and Group CEO, Advantest Corp.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry is entering a new era in which complexity,
cost, and performance pressures converge. Meeting these demands will
require unprecedented collaboration across the supply chain. In 2026 and
beyond, collaboration will be key to pioneering best-in-class test cells
that drive velocity and innovation.</p>
<p>From a market perspective, we see artificial intelligence (AI)
continuing to drive significant growth in the semiconductor market,
spurring new innovations in advanced packaging, high-bandwidth memory
(HBM), thermal control, and optical integration to support the next
generation of high-performance GPUs. As these complex challenges
combine, testing plays a key role in enabling customers to meet
time-to-market and quality requirements.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we anticipate continued advancements in 2.5D/3D
packaging to enable higher performance in AI and high-performance
computing (HPC) devices. Foundries and OSATs are making significant
investments in next-generation packaging technology, such as
chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS), EMIB, through-silicon vias (TSVs),
and co-packaged optics (CPO). HBM and other advanced memory technologies
also rely on 3D stacking to offer the high processing speeds needed to
fuel AI applications.</p>
<p>The increasingly complex architecture of 2.5D/3D chips presents various
challenges during test. For example, heightened density and processing
speeds elevate temperatures, increasing the risk of failure after
wafer-level and final test. This necessitates specialized test equipment
with sophisticated thermal-management capabilities and active thermal
control. We foresee a growing need for more testing at the
singulated-die level, where more precise thermal control can be achieved
to capture failures before stacking and ensure only known-good die are
packaged.</p>
<p>In addition to die-level test, customers are looking for more ways to
reduce yield loss, especially as the cost of 3D packaged devices rises.
In response, test companies are moving more test content to earlier
insertions. For example, much of the speed and performance testing that
used to be reserved for final test is now being performed at wafer sort
or singulated die test to ensure that the die can perform
high-performance workloads before they are packaged.</p>
<p>We are also beginning to see system-level test content being combined
with other test insertions, ensuring better test coverage throughout the
back-end flow. We expect all of these trends in test to continue into
2026 as customers seek ways to reduce yield loss and cut costs, and we
look forward to seeing what the year ahead will bring.</p>

<p><strong>[Spotlight on Business]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trusted Innovation, Navigating Complexity---Interview with Advantest
CxOs</strong></p>
<p><em>As the industry enters a new era characterized by the rapid development
of AI technology and increasing complexity, Advantest's global CxO team
is working together closely to determine the best strategies for
navigating today's market. We spoke with Chief Technology Officer
Juergen Serrer, Chief Supply Chain Officer Richard Junger, and Chief
Customer Relations Officer Sanjeev Mohan about their collaborative
process and their plans to drive future success.</em></p>
<p><em>This article is excerpted from Advantest's 2025 Integrated Annual
Report. The full version can be viewed
<a href="https://www.advantest.com/en/investors/ir-library/annual/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>By Go SEMI &amp; BEYOND Staff</p>
<p><strong>What is complexity, and where do we see it in the semiconductor
industry today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Serrer</strong>: Our customers are now faced with the fact that multiple new
technologies are stacking up. For example, chiplets are small integrated
circuits designed for a specific function and are paired with multiple
other chiplets in a single package. Chiplets enable higher performance,
scalability, and yield. However, with stacking and integration, chiplets
also present unique thermal challenges, which are significant factors in
failure mechanisms. Additionally, new technologies in various fields are
driving the evolution of semiconductors, such as silicon photonics and
enormous amounts of memory with HBM, all of which are accelerating
simultaneously. Not to mention, our customers are in a time-to-market
race. All of these challenges are combined under the term "complexity."</p>
<p><strong>Junger</strong>: The complexity of devices designed and manufactured by our
customers adds complexity to their supply chains, which in turn
increases the complexity of our own supply chains. Additionally, the
supply side of the market is also experiencing complexity due to
geopolitical challenges stemming from the evolving dynamics of the AI
industry.</p>
<p>So, we are essentially facing complexity on both ends: on the customer
side and on the supply chain side.</p>
<p><strong>What does growing complexity mean for the industry, and for
Advantest?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mohan</strong>: As complexity grows, our customers are expecting more from
Advantest. In the past, we have been leaders in ATE. But now, as these
devices become increasingly complex, customers are seeking a
comprehensive solution and our total expertise regarding a variety of
subjects such as parts management, device handling, thermal power
challenges, and any other concerns they may have.</p>
<p><strong>Serrer</strong>: The problems we are seeing in the industry right now are
interdisciplinary. Years ago, a design problem could only be solved in
design. Problems with test were addressed by the test team. However, the
issues we face today can only be resolved through collaboration between
all disciplines. The Era of Complexity needs solutions along all
insertions, and the solutions need to be interdisciplinary. That is why
we are talking to EDA companies and have partnerships with probe card
companies. We are working to ensure that we not only deliver a tester
but also provide a comprehensive solution, including interfaces and
peripherals that they need.</p>
<p>As for what complexity means for Advantest, this complexity is good for
us because it drives the need for more tests, additional test
capabilities, and new test methodologies. So, rather than a threat, I
think it presents a unique opportunity for Advantest.</p>
<p><strong>How is the role of test evolving, and how must Advantest transform to
keep pace with the rising complexity in customer needs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Serrer:</strong> Like I said before, the issues our customers see are
interdisciplinary. All technologies are stacking, and they are asking us
for more efficiency. So, how do you do that? Unlike in the past when
test was a binary go/no-go decision, today's role of test involves
device trimming that adjusts the underlying design, so devices are
calibrated properly and perform as intended. This enables engineers to
feed back data to improve both design and manufacturing processes. As
semiconductors have become increasingly complex, featuring multiple
chiplets and memory ICs stacked and packaged into a single device,
testing has evolved to employ a wide range of test methodologies and
capabilities, adapting to the diverse needs of different devices and
test scenarios. Our strategy is to innovate the entire flow, linking all
test insertions from design to wafer sort, final test, and system-level
test, into one unified flow. With that in mind, our newly released
product SiConic™ plays a significant role because it allows us to bridge
the gap between ATE and EDA or design. We want to make sure that test
content is debugged, reusable, and that the data acquired during testing
is analyzed and fed back to improve the design and manufacturing
process. This approach aligns with our "Automation of Test" strategy,
which aims to increase efficiency and enable our customers to accelerate
their time-to-market and enhance product quality.</p>
<p><strong>What sets Advantest apart? What specific strengths does the company
have in testing AI/HPC applications?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mohan:</strong> Advantest's growth over the last year has come as a result of
our market position in the AI-related business segment. There are many
reasons for this success. It starts with our V93000 product line, which
has been an industry leader in the high-performance compute space for
many, many years. With our V93000, we have been testing GPUs for
decades, and we have learned a lot in terms of how to test these types
of devices. Because of our technical expertise, we have also had strong
relationships with leading manufacturers of HPC devices for a very long
period of time. As I mentioned earlier, we value our relationships with
our customers, and we cater to a diverse set of needs, ranging from
technical to business and commercial aspects. That has really allowed us
to develop products in line with our customers' offerings, so we can
evolve together and set ourselves apart in this space.</p>
<p><strong>Looking ahead, what future trends do you see affecting Advantest's
business in the future? What investments are key to maintaining a
competitive edge?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Serrer:</strong> I think we have been pretty good in recent years at
predicting trends---something that is reflected in our market leadership
in high-performance computing, AI, and high-bandwidth memory. Key trends
we are seeing now include more test content, higher speeds, thermal, and
power, also resulting in changing test methodologies. We will continue
to invest in efficiency and optimization, for sure. Second, we will
continue to invest in technology leadership, whether that is ASIC
development, high-speed interfacing technology, or die-level handling
solutions.</p>
<p>There is also silicon photonic testing---something we have been
investing in for a long time.</p>
<p>Internally, we must become more efficient to keep pace with the rapid
growth in the AI market. We have structured the test system business
group in a way that allows us to have business units for every market
segment, enabling us to learn quickly and respond effectively. Under my
leadership, I ensure that the views and components of each business unit
are aligned to create a cohesive test strategy along all insertions for
our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Junger:</strong> Based on our MTP3 strategy to promote operational
excellence, we are driving a digital transformation of our entire supply
chain. This is something I will manage in my integrated roles of Chief
Supply Chain Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief
Digitalization Officer. Our focus now is on building a "Connected Supply
Chain"---a fully integrated, data-driven ecosystem that provides
real-time visibility across demand, order status, production, and
delivery. This digital infrastructure allows us to share data with our
partners, empowering them to make quick decisions and respond flexibly
to market changes.</p>
<p>To unlock further value, we are applying AI and advanced analytics to
identify and resolve issues that were previously undetectable, paving
the way for significant improvements in quality, productivity, and
responsiveness.</p>
<p>We consider digital transformation to be essential to future
competitiveness.</p>
