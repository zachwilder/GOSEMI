# W2BI’s New MLT1600 Device Test Automation Platform Addresses LTE, GSM and WCDMA Capabilities for the Burgeoning IoT and Smartphone Markets

W2BI, an Advantest Group company and a global leader in wireless device test automation products for the world’s top wireless operators, suppliers and labs, has introduced the MLT1600 cloud-enabled, device test automation tester as the newest member of its Micro Line Tester portfolio. The MLT1600 addresses the testing challenges of IoT products across multiple cellular radio technologies – such as GSM, WCDMA and LTE – with a 70-MHz to 6-GHz frequency range. With its portable design and small footprint, the MLT1600 leverages W2BI’s existing cloud-based test management platform to acquire on-demand test cases and publish test results as required across all test parameters.

During Verizon’s Test Fest in Bridgewater, N.J., W2BI demonstrated the MLT1600 with multiple-use case scenarios, including device connectivity, VoLTE, IMS roaming, data performance, UICC and more. The system software includes commercial-grade eNodeB, EPC, IMS and built-in Web-App-FTP servers to provide end-to-end network emulation in support of automated testing to accelerate time to market with increased capacity.

As mobile devices continue to grow in number, they are becoming increasingly sophisticated and able to perform complex functions across all industries and consumer markets. Cellular networks, which span the globe with standardized mobile access and interoperability, are seeing a proliferation of IoT devices and applications. To ensure that devices and services remain highly reliable, wireless operators around the world need to ensure that new technologies meet the demands and the security requirements of the expanding IoT ecosystem.

To support this growth, W2BI is simplifying the testing process by offering MLT products that use multi-level intuitive reporting to enable rapid troubleshooting and root cause analysis of test failures. The results can be published over the cloud to allow remote log analysis. In addition, MLT test equipment automation products are expandable, easy to use and offer shorter test cycles with more comprehensive analysis.

W2BI is continually pursuing ways of lowering the cost of testing and making the technology accessible to all groups across the mobile ecosystem. The company is constantly expanding their test automation scripts that support mobile operator-specific and industry standards-based test specifications, such as 3GPP, Global Certification Forum and CTIA, to accelerate and simplify the testing process.
