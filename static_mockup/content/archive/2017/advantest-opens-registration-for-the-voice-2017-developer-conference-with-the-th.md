# Advantest Opens Registration for the VOICE 2017 Developer Conference with the Theme of “Measure the Connected World and Everything in It”

Advantest opened registration to attend its VOICE 2017 Developer Conference being held in Palm Springs, California, on May 16-17 and Shanghai, China, on May 26. As VOICE kicks off its second decade, both conferences will feature the theme “Measure the Connected World and Everything in It.” 

This theme is a guiding principle that reflects Advantest’s company-wide commitment to test, measure, analyze and report on the most critical performance parameters of the smart semiconductor devices that enable the ever-expanding Internet of Things (IoT). Advantest’s technologies touch all ICs that enable today’s interconnected world, helping to improve the ways people communicate, conduct business, access entertainment, manage life, and more. 

At VOICE 2017, attendees will have access to wide-ranging learning and networking opportunities, including general sessions, social events and technical presentations focused on eight topic areas (hot topics, device-specific testing, hardware design and integration, improving throughput, reducing time-to-market, new hardware/software test solutions, test methodologies, and product engineering). Additionally, the conference will showcase its sponsor partners in a special Expo area, and the VOICE Technology Kiosk Showcase will expand to include more interactive discussion sessions in both locations. 

The general session in Palm Springs will feature a keynote on *Cyber Security* by former FBI special agent Chris Tarbell, one of the most successful cyber security law enforcement officials of all time. More program information is available on the VOICE website at [https://voice.advantest.com](https://voice.advantest.com).
