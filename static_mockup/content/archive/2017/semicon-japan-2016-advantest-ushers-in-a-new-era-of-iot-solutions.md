# SEMICON JAPAN 2016 – Advantest Ushers in a New Era of IoT Solutions

Advantest showcased an innovative booth in celebration of SEMICON Japan’s 40th anniversary during SEMICON Japan, held December 14-16, 2016.  Inspired by the Internet of Things (IoT) theme, Advantest’s booth was divided into the four segments of IoT:  Connected Homes, Connected Automobiles, Industrial, and Wireless.  Showcasing 19 of its products and services, the displays included several interactive demonstrations that incorporated virtual reality and augmented reality techniques, as well as mock-up system displays. The interactivity of the booth attracted quite a lot of attention from visitors including customers, partners and media.

In addition, Advantest received two awards at the SEMI President’s reception.  The first was presented to former President and CEO Shinichiro Kuroe for his many years of support and participation at SEMICON Japan, and the second award was presented to Chairman Toshio Maruyama for his significant contributions to the fields of sales and marketing throughout his career in the semiconductor industry.   

Advantest also participated in the technical program with a presentation in the Connected Automobile area delivered by Shin’ichi Kimura, Vice President, ASD Test Business Group. Overall, SEMICON Japan 2016 drew over 64,000 attendees.
