# Advantest to Debut New Solid-State-Drive Testers and Present Technical Papers at Flash Memory Summit, August 8-10 in Santa Clara, California

 

Advantest Corporation will showcase the latest additions to its MPT3000 series of solid-state drive (SSD) test solutions and present two technical papers at this year’s Flash Memory Summit on August 8-10 at the Santa Clara Convention Center. Advantest is an emerald sponsor of the 2017 Summit.

In booths #606-608, Advantest will present two new options for its MPT3000 platform, adding to the range of SSD protocols and form factors that it supports. The new MPT3000HES leverages the same hardware, software, thermal performance and interfaces used throughout the MPT3000 series, but in a smaller configuration designed for “copy exactly” engineering and lower-volume applications. In addition, the new Smart Power option is a highly cost-effective solution for built-in self-test (BIST) needs, including production test insertions in which a low-speed serial interface can provide maximum synergy with protocol test insertions.

Advantest’s exhibit will also feature a digital display and laptop demonstration of the cost-efficient [T5851 tester](https://www.advantest.com/products/ic-test-systems/t5851) for universal flash storage (UFS) devices and PCIe BGA memories. This system uses the same proven test architecture at the MPT3000 product family.

The company’s technical experts will make two presentations at the summit during Session 201-C on Testing Issues, which begins at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, August 9. Advantest’s Vishal Devadiya will address “Preparing SSDs for Qualification Testing” and Ben Rogel Favila will discuss “A Scalable Platform for Optimal SSD Test.”
