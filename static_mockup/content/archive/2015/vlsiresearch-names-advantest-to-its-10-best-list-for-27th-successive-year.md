# VLSIresearch Names Advantest to Its 10 BEST List for 27th Successive Year

Leading semiconductor market-research firm [VLSIresearch](http://www.vlsiresearch.com) recently revealed the results of its annual Customer Satisfaction Survey. The responses provided by global customers placed Advantest Corporation on the esteemed VLSIresearch 10 BEST List for the 27th consecutive year. In 2015, Advantest surpassed its personal best scores from prior years, achieving its highest customer ratings in the areas of recommended supplier and technical leadership.

The findings from the survey cited Advantest’s improved ratings in 14 of the 15 categories, landing the overall score above 9.0 for the first time. The company ranked high among THE BEST suppliers of test equipment in 2015, and was also one of the 10 BEST large suppliers of chip making equipment.

More than 96 percent of the chip market provides feedback to the survey, which rates equipment suppliers across 15 categories based on three key factors: supplier performance, customer service, and product performance. “Earning a top ranking in the VLSIresearch Customer Satisfaction Survey underscores Advantest’s core commitment to serving our customers,” stated Shinchiro Kuroe, Advantest Corporation president and CEO. “Across the organization, we remain focused on delivering the highest value of service and support to our customers, and we are delighted that the strategies, people, processes and equipment that we’ve implemented to support the semiconductor industry are having tangible results. We truly appreciate our customers’ recognition and continued confidence.”

VLSIresearch CEO G. Dan Hutcheson noted, “For as long as our Customer Satisfaction Survey has been measuring customer feedback, global customers have paid tribute to Advantest’s ability to deliver superior products along with high quality service and support. Maintaining the customer at the center of the decision-making process is what enables Advantest to support this kind of distinction over time. It’s abundantly clear that Advantest remains dedicated to its customers’ success.”

VLSIresearch also indicated that 2014 was notable for the strong recovery in the test sector, evidenced by 22 percent sales growth in ATE. As one of the top two providers in the space, Advantest shares about 50 percent of overall sales for test and related equipment. Advantest has long been the industry’s only ATE provider to design and manufacture its own fully integrated suite of test-cell solutions, comprising testers, handlers, device interfaces, and software to assure the industry’s highest levels of integrity and compatibility.

As the industry evolves to deliver new test solutions that address the needs of emerging markets and technologies, particularly around automotive, IoT and other smart products, Advantest will maintain its longstanding, razor-sharp focus on providing exceptional products and support to enable our customers’ ongoing success.
