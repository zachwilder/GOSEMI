# VOICE 2015 Attracts Over 400 Attendees on Two Continents

 

Advantest made its VOICE 2015 Developer Conference a truly international forum in May by holding the event in both Santa Clara, Calif., and Shanghai, China – the first time that this annual gathering of test equipment users, suppliers and partners has been held outside the United States. More than 400 people attended the events, which featured 79 technical papers on May 12-13 in Silicon Valley and 24 presentations on May 22 in Shanghai.

In addition to its geographic growth, VOICE 2015 also set a new record for international speakers with presenters coming from 14 countries, up from 11 last year. The conference continues to expand by including new companies and new ideas. Of the 134 abstracts submitted this year, more than 41 percent came from authors who had not presented at any prior VOICE conferences. Among those candidates trying to become first-time presenters at VOICE, more than 78 percent were from Advantest customers, an indicator of the high value that chipmakers place on this annual forum.

The sessions were packed with technical talks on topics such as the latest testing capabilities enabled by Advantest’s V93000 and T2000 platforms, production test cells, product engineering and emerging test technologies. In addition, attendees benefited from multiple networking opportunities at both events.

**VOICE in Silicon Valley**

In Silicon Valley, VOICE began with a welcome address by Advantest America, Inc. President and CEO Doug Lefever. Technical product highlights were presented by Andree Weyh, Amit Monga and Zain Abadin of Advantest. Then global adventurer and award-winning author [Paul Deegan](http://www.pauldeegan.com/about/) gave an inspirational keynote address called “Breathless: Embracing Uncertainty at 29,000 Feet.” On the second day, many attendees spoke directly with Advantest test experts at on-site kiosks. After the two-day conference, a supplemental day of workshops was offered at Advantest’s San Jose headquarters for customers wanting more detailed, hands-on training.

**VOICE in China**

The inaugural VOICE in Shanghai, which was completely filled several weeks before the event, opened with a welcome speech by Yong Xu, CEO of Advantest China Co., Ltd. The keynote speaker was Dr. Jonathan Sang, senior director of the Testing & Outsourcing Unit from [HH Grace](http://www.hhgrace.com/En/AboutUs/Overview.aspx), who spoke on “Diversified Technologies for the Wearable Market.”

**Best Paper Awards**

With technical presentations at its core, VOICE recognizes the best paper at each conference with an award judged by attendees. This year’s winners at the Silicon Valley event were Luis Neria Govea of Qualcomm and Frank Dollendorf of Advantest for their talk on “Different Methods for Run-Time Vector Manipulation and Their Test Time Impacts.” In Shanghai, the best paper award went to Michael Min and Liang Ge of Advantest for their presentation entitled “Examining a Sequencer-Controlled Search-Trimming Solution with Conditional Jump.” VOICE 2015 attendees may obtain instructions on how to get the published proceedings on the conference website at [www.advantest.com/voice](http://www.advantest.com/voice)
