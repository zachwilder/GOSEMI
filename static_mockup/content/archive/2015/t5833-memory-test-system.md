# T5833 Memory Test System

[](https://www.gosemiandbeyond.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/T5833-150604_044.gif)To keep pace with users’ performance demands in the booming market for mobile electronics, the semiconductors that drive smart phones and tablet computers as well as the servers that support them – primarily DRAMs, NAND Flash memories, multi-chip packages (MCPs) and next-generation non-volatile memories including MRAM, RRAM and PCM — are becoming faster and higher capacity. This raises the need for test solutions that have both the high functionality to test today’s most advanced memory ICs and the cost-efficient operation to address high-volume consumer markets.

The versatile T5833 memory test system combines industry-leading performance and low cost of test to maximize customers’ return on investment. The tester is designed to perform both wafer sort and final test across a wide range of memory devices including LPDDR3-DRAMs, MCPs, high-speed NAND flash memories and next-generation non-volatile memory ICs.
