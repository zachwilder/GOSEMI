# Advantest and Synopsys: Taking Test Cost Reduction to the Next Level (Webinar)

SoC designers can substantially reduce manufacturing test costs by employing specific methodologies that leverage advances in both EDA software and test systems. In this recent 60-minute webinar, two methodologies are highlighted — multisite test and concurrent test — that minimize test application time and maximize throughput. How Synopsys DFTMAX Ultra and Advantest SoC Test Solutions enable successful deployment are also discussed. The Webinar features Dave Armstrong, director of Business Development, Advantest; Adam Cron, principal engineer, Synopsy; and Chris Allsup, marketing manager, Synopsys. The webinar replay is available [here](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/prereg/register.jsp?eventid=972455&sessionid=1&key=3F9CF2B5BD465CAD93B3366F7EF5DD05).
