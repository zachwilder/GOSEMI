# Advantest’s 2022 VOICE Developer Conference Concludes with Record Attendance

Advantest held its VOICE 2022 Developer Conference on May 17-18 in Scottsdale, Arizona, achieving maximum attendance and sponsorship capacity. Over 300 people attended the event, the majority of whom were Advantest customers and partners. The 2022 conference represented over 60 companies and included presentations of more than 60 technical papers over two days.

VOICE 2022 received 119 abstract submissions from 31 companies across 13 countries. A total of 66 papers were accepted for presentation during the technical breakout sessions, half of which were written or co-authored by customers.

In addition to the technical sessions, VOICE featured a Partners’ Expo, three highly rated keynote speakers, and a first-time “fireside chat” conducted between G. Dan Hutcheson, vice chair of TechInsights, and Manish Bhatia, executive vice president of Global Operations at Micron.

Through the VOICE mobile app, attendees voted to select the best technical presentations and best technology kiosk.  A Visionary Award was also named for ongoing, sustained support of VOICE by a customer.

**Best Paper**

- “New ATE Testing Techniques Using PCI-Express with Link Scale-PCIe to Solve Scan, Structural, Protocol and Third-Party Integration Challenges” / Brendan Tully—Amazon, Mike Kozma—Advantest
- “Migrating the Test of Medium Power Mainstream SOC Devices Using UHC4T/DPS128 to a Single XPS256 DPS Solution” / Stefan Walther and Linda Hänel—Advantest
