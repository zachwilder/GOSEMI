# Advantest Joins European GaN4AP Consortium to Promote Pervasive Use of Gallium Nitride in Power Conversion Systems

Advantest Europe GmbH recently joined the European Union (EU)-sponsored consortium Gallium Nitride for Advanced Power Applications (GaN4AP). Launched in December 2021, the three-year project is focused on making GaN technology one of the main components in a broad spectrum of power converter systems. GaN-based electronics have the potential to enable drastic reductions in energy loss for electronics systems while ensuring high-frequency and higher-power-density operation. Developing new power supply devices and circuits using GaN-based electronics is viewed as crucial for the global competitiveness of EU industries.

GaN4AP comprises a diverse group of private companies, universities, and public research institutes working in the field of GaN materials, devices, and related applications. Advantest joined the consortium through engagement with key customers seeking to test GaN-based electronics in mass production. Participating expands our access to GaN technology, as well as our competitiveness in testing power semiconductors.

As the GaN4AP project’s lead ATE provider, Advantest will work to further address the testing demands of various markets leveraging power semiconductors that stand to realize significantly improved performance from the pervasive use of GaN, without sacrificing system size and cost. Examples include power transmission and distribution, consumer electronics, renewable energy, automotive, and other industrial applications.

“Advantest has been testing advanced compound semiconductors, including GaN devices, for some time,” said Michael Stichlmair, managing director, Advantest Europe. “Joining this exciting project is a logical next step in our efforts to continuously drive test innovation, allowing us to access new markets while contributing to broader use of GaN technology.”
