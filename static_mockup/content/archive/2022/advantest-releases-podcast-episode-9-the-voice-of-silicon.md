# Advantest Releases Podcast Episode 9: The VOICE of Silicon

What would semiconductor chips say if every chip had its own “VOICE” and communicated in a variety of languages? Would self-driving cars talk among themselves, rendering traffic a thing of the past? And would they continuously monitor and discuss their conditions and their life expectancies? Would chips be programmed to communicate directly with Advantest testers using their native languages? Listen in as Steve Pateras, vice president of marketing and strategic business development at Synopsys, Klaus Dieter Hilliges, Advantest 93000 platform extension manager, and I, Keith Schaub, vice president of technology and strategy at Advantest, discuss this revelation and some of the many innovations being showcased at the annual Advantest VOICE developer conference taking place May 17-18th 2022 at the OMNI Montelucia in Scottsdale, Arizona.  [https://www.buzzsprout.com/1607350/10426123](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1607350/10426123)
