On February 21, 2025, 56 volunteers from Advantest Singapore participated in a tree planting event at Windsor Nature Park in collaboration with the National Park of Singapore (NPARKS). Together, the volunteers planted 50 trees, contributing 15,000 SGD to the Garden City Fund and reinforcing the company’s commitment to environmental conservation. This initiative aligns with NPARKS’ “One Million Trees” movement, a nationwide effort to transform Singapore into a City in Nature by 2030 and is also a key part of Advantest’s sustainability initiatives. By planting trees and supporting conservation efforts, Advantest is taking meaningful steps to reduce its environmental footprint and nurture a greener tomorrow.

Last May, 20 volunteers from Advantest Test Solutions (ATS) assisted the food bank of South County Outreach (SCO) in Irvine, California. Together, volunteers sorted through a combined total of 8,200 lbs (roughly 3,720 kilos) of donated fresh produce, canned and packaged goods. These goods eventually made it onto the shelves of the SCO food bank that serves local families and individuals who are unhoused or are currently experiencing financial hardship. Advantest is pleased to team up with SCO and participate in their mission to serve our local community.
