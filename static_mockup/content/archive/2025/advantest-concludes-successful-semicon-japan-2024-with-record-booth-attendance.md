# Advantest Concludes Successful SEMICON Japan 2024 with Record Booth Attendance

Advantest displayed exceptional leadership at SEMICON Japan 2024, held on December 11-13 at the Tokyo Big Sight. As a result of Japan’s efforts to bolster its domestic semiconductor industry, this year’s event saw a record attendance of over 100,000 people compared to 85,000 attendees in 2023. Advantest’s booth received a record number of over 3,500 visitors, including customers, government officials, media personnel, and financial experts. Advantest conducted six interviews with highly respected media outlets such as *DigiTimes* and *Sangyo Times*, garnering significant media attention.

Advantest proudly celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2024, embracing this significant milestone with cherished customers and industry partners under the inspiring theme “Facing the Future Together” at SEMICON Japan.

Our application-based display showcased our solutions for applications like artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance compute (HPC), 5G, and automotive. We featured various new products, such as the PMUX02, Wave Scale RF20ex, XHC32, ACS Gemini, and HA1100 Die Prober, highlighting our expansive portfolio.

As a gold sponsor, Advantest sponsored various aspects of this year’s event, including the APCS (Advanced Packaging and Chiplet Summit), sustainability forum, AI technical forum, and many other events during the show. Additionally, Senior Director/Principal Test Strategist Shinji Fujita presented “Optimization of Test Strategies for Innovative Chiplets for HPC/AI Applications” during the SEMI Technology Symposium (STS).
