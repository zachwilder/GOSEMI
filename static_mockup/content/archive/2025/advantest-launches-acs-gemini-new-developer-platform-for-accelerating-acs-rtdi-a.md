# Advantest Launches ACS Gemini™ – New Developer Platform for Accelerating ACS RTDI™ Application Development

Last December, Advantest announced the launch of its new software development platform [ACS Gemini™](https://www.advantest.com/en/products/acs/gemini/), which allows customers to develop, simulate and debug machine learning applications in a virtual environment. The digital twin of [ACS RTDI™](https://www.advantest.com/en/products/acs/rtdi/), ACS Gemini is part of Advantest’s mission to enable customers and partners to utilize data analytics in developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions for semiconductor testing. 

In recent years, manufacturing costs for semiconductors have increased significantly due to their growing complexity. Analysts at [McKinsey & Company ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/scaling-ai-in-the-sector-that-enables-it-lessons-for-semiconductor-device-makers)predict that implementing AI and ML could lower manufacturing costs by 40%, as many engineers use these technologies to optimize efficiency in manufacturing. 

ACS Gemini improves efficiency by providing customers with a seamlessly integrated experience that optimizes design-to-production proficiency in the virtual ACS RTDI environment. The digital twin software solution is composed of the ACS Software Development Kit, Reference Application Development Model, and Containerized applications publishable to the ACS Container Hub™. These elements enable customers to simulate valuable test results in a virtual production setting. 

ACS Gemini saves customers time and cost in engineering debugging, design vs. production correlation, and cloud deployment of apps—ultimately saving valuable tester time. Overall, the solution accelerates ML application development, simulates testing results, and shortens time-to-deployment of ML applications on the production test floor. 

Advantest’s ACS RTDI is a real-time data infrastructure platform-as-a-service that securely collects, analyzes, stores and monitors semiconductor test data to empower customers to automate the process of converting insights into actionable test decisions within milliseconds. This helps customers and partners reduce test time, optimize quality and reliability and enhance smart packaging.
