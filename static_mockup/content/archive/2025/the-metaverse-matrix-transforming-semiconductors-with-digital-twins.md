# The Metaverse Matrix: Transforming Semiconductors with Digital Twins

Join us on “Advantest Talks Semi” as we explore the transformative impact of the industrial metaverse with Don Ong and his guest, Sanjeev Kumar.

Sanjeev Kumar is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and advisor specializing in enterprise AI, data management, tech-bio, and industrial automation. With over seven years of investment experience, he has worked closely with early and mid-stage startups through venture capital (VC) firms and accelerators. Previously, Sanjeev held leadership roles at Informatica, BEA Systems, EMC, and Oracle, focusing on machine learning, data engineering, and enterprise software platforms. He also served as managing director of India R&D and GM for multiple products at BEA Systems and Informatica. Sanjeev holds an MS in computer science from Rutgers University and a BS from BITS, Pilani, India.

In this episode, we dive into how the industrial metaverse is reshaping semiconductor manufacturing, from digital twins optimizing production efficiency to real-time analytics driving smarter decision-making. Sanjeev shares insights on how AI, IoT, and advanced simulations are converging to revolutionize supply chains, predictive maintenance, and factory automation. We also discuss the role of edge computing and distributed security models in enabling seamless data exchange between physical and virtual environments.

From early digital modeling techniques to today’s persistent and immersive industrial metaverse, this conversation provides a comprehensive look at the evolution of these technologies and their future impact on semiconductor testing, design, and manufacturing.
