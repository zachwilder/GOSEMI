# Advantest Launches KGD Test Cell for Power Semiconductors

Late last year, Advantest announced an integrated test cell designed to maximize die-level test yields for wide-bandgap (WBG) devices essential to power semiconductors. The Advantest Known Good Die (KGD) Test Cell combines the company’s [CREA MT Series](https://www.advantest.com/en/products/semicondoctor-test-system/ps/st-mt-family/) power device testers with the new HA1100 die prober. 

Demand for power semiconductors continues to grow with the rapid escalation of electric vehicles (EV) and power infrastructure. WBG devices, particularly silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are essential for the design and manufacture of power semiconductors, enabling them to be smaller, faster, and more efficient than silicon-based devices. However, failure screening of WBG devices is challenging, as the probe card, the chuck, and the devices can be damaged due to the devices operating at very high voltage and current. 

Essentially serving as a one-stop shop for efficient equipment management, the Advantest KGD test cell solution helps reduce customers’ manufacturing costs. CREA’s proprietary probe card interface (PCI) technology can eliminate damage risk. Even if damage issues occur, Advantest will investigate it with the test cell. Customers can minimize the downtime of the test cell. The HA1100 die prober for the CREA MT Series test systems enables assembly of dies in power modules using only passed (KGD) die, ensuring no failed die find their way into the module. This prevents yield loss at module test, thus reducing the loss of final multi-die assembled power modules.
