# New V93000 Wave Scale Millimeter Solution Cost-Effectively Tests 5G-NR mmWave Devices up to 70 GHz

Advantest Corporation has extended its V93000 system
to cost-efficiently test the next generation of 5G-NR radio frequency devices
and modules on a single scalable platform. 
The new V93000 Wave Scale Millimeter solution has the high multi-site
parallelism and versatility needed for multi-band millimeter-wave (mmWave)
frequencies.  The operational range from
24 GHz to 44 GHz and 57 GHz to 70 GHz enables customers to reduce their time to
market for new designs running at mmWave frequencies.

The highly integrated system is architecturally
distinctive from other solutions by providing as many as 64 bi-directional
mmWave ports based on a modular implementation. 
This allows not only the use of different 5G and WiGig frequency
modules, but also the addition of new modules as new frequency bands are rolled
out worldwide.  Based on an innovative
mmWave card cage with up to eight
mmWave instruments, this highly versatile and cost-effective ATE solution
performs on the level of high-end bench instruments.  The scalable system’s wideband testing
functionality gives it the capability to handle full-rate modulation and
de-modulation for ultra-wideband (UWB), 5G-NR mmWave up to 1 GHz, WiGig
(802.11ad/ay) up to 2 GHz and antenna-in-package (AiP) devices in addition to
beamforming and over-the-air testing.

In delivering the industry’s first integrated,
multi-site mmWave ATE test solution, Advantest is providing a pathway for
customers to lower the cost of test for their current and upcoming 5G-NR devices
while leveraging their existing investments in our well-established Wave Scale
RF testers.  In particular, OSAT
companies can benefit greatly from this flexible, scalable mmWave ATE solution.

Early installations at customers testing both 5G
and WiGig multi-band devices have been completed.  Advantest is now accepting orders for the new
mmWave solution.
