# New T2000 Module Has Industry’s Highest Analog Digitizer for Cost-Efficient Testing of High-Res Audio ICs

Advantest’s new
GPWGD high-resolution module features the industry’s highest analog-performance
digitizer, which supports testing of high-resolution audio digital-to-analog
converters (DACs) embedded in power-management ICs (PMICs) as well as
stand-alone high-resolution audio devices. The module’s innovative measurement
technique performs over an ultra-high dynamic range, achieving unprecedented
accuracy in analog testing from device characterization to mass production
without requiring complex performance boards or additional test and measurement instruments on the
T2000 test platform.

High-resolution audio features both a wider dynamic range and an improved
sound source compared to CDs. The proliferation of electronic devices capable
of supporting high-resolution audio – including smart phones, wireless audio
components for wearable electronics and home theaters, automotive navigation
systems, gaming consoles, 4K and 8K televisions, and other next-generation
products – has led to an increase in the number of PMICs with embedded
digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which require high-dynamic-range testing
with 24-bit or 32-bit resolution.

When used on the T2000 platform, the GPWGD high-resolution module[ ]()provides the versatility to test both PMICs and high-resolution audio DACs using the same system configuration.  This helps users to save on their capital investments while also reducing test cycle times.

The module’s upward compatibility and the high-resolution functionality of
its digitizer enable industry-leading measurements with both a signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and a dynamic range (DR) of 130 dB, surpassing the analog
performance of other testers typically used by developers of audio ICs. In
addition, the unit’s massive parallel site testing capability leverages twice
the number of sites compared to other systems on the market, resulting in
higher throughput and a lower cost of test.

The new GPWGD
high-resolution module’s extendible design allows it to be seamlessly integrated into either
laboratory or production environments for existing device types as well as new
high-resolution audio ICs.****
