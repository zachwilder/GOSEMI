# VOICE 2019 Developer Conference Gears Up for an Exciting Technical Program

Advantest is previewing the technical program and complete list of keynote speakers for both locations of its VOICE 2019 Developer Conference.  For the first time, the conference will be held in Scottsdale, Arizona on May 14-15 and Singapore on May 23 under the unifying theme “Measure the Connected World and Everything in ItSM.”

“The semiconductor
industry is using technology to build a smarter world,” said Adam Styblinski,
technical chairman of the VOICE 2019 Developer Conference and AMD product
development engineer.  “With presentations on hot topics including 5G,
MIMO and mmWave advancements, VOICE 2019 keeps attendees up to date on cutting-edge
technologies and the testing challenges they present.”

### VOICE 2019 Program

The heart of VOICE continues to be its
comprehensive learning and networking opportunities comprised of a [technical
program](https://voice.advantest.com/scottsdale-technical-program/) featuring more than 90 presentations across both locations with
submissions from authors representing 28 companies and 10 countries; Partners’
Expos; social gatherings; Technology Kiosks; and stimulating keynote speakers.
 This year’s technical tracks will focus on device/system level test, the
internet of things (IoT), test methodologies, hardware and software design
integration, the latest hot topics and – for the first time in 2019 – test
solutions enabled by Advantest’s T2000 platform.  Each location will host
a technology kiosk showcase offering attendees the opportunity to interact
directly with Advantest product experts.

The general session on May 14 in Scottsdale
will include an Advantest technology discussion panel moderated by Hans-Juergen
Wagner, senior vice president of the SoC business group and managing executive
officer at Advantest Corporation.  Four of the company’s leading test
experts – Rich Lathrop, Hagen Goller, Masayuki Suzuki and Koichi Tsukui – will
sit on the panel and field questions from VOICE attendees.

### VOICE 2019 Keynotes

On the second day of VOICE in
Scottsdale, the program will feature two keynote speeches by dynamic technology
leaders.  The first speaker, Dr. Walden “Wally” Rhines, CEO emeritus of
Mentor, a Siemens Business, is a recognized spokesperson for the semiconductor
and EDA industries.  The second keynote speech, sponsored by EAG Eurofins
Engineering Science, will be given by Dr. Hugh Herr, renowned engineer,
biophysicist and leader of MIT Media Lab’s Biomechatronics Group.  Dr.
Herr is building the next generation of robotic prosthetics, sophisticated
devices that aid human movement by mimicking nature.

For VOICE
Singapore, the featured keynote speech on “Industry 4.0: Preparing for the
Future of Work” will be delivered by Mark Stuart, co-founder of Anagram Group,
a global corporate-training company based in Singapore that won the British
Chamber of Commerce’s 2018 “Future of Work” award for contributions in
developing future-ready leaders and transforming organizations through
innovation. Stuart is a speaker, trainer and executive coach specializing in
leadership and innovation. He works with more than 170 government and corporate
