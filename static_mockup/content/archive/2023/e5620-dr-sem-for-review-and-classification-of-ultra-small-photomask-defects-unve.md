# E5620 DR-SEM for Review and Classification of Ultra-Small Photomask Defects Unveiled

In December 2022, Advantest unveiled the [E5620 Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscope (DR-SEM)](https://www.advantest.com/products/sem/e5620.html), its newest mask SEM product for reviewing and classifying ultra-small defects on photomasks and mask blanks. With its high-accuracy, high-throughput defect review capability, the E5620 DR-SEM is expected to contribute appreciably to production quality improvements in next-generation photomasks and shorter mask manufacturing turnaround times.

Like its predecessor, the E5620 implements Advantest’s highly stable image capture technology to easily import defect location data from mask inspection systems and automatically image the locations. The system has a number of improvements that specifically target future mask requirements.

“In working with our customers to determine their requirements for future EUV photomask inspection and analysis, we identified several essential advancements to integrate into our proven DR-SEM system,” said Toshimichi Iwai, senior VP of the Nanotechnology Business Group with Advantest. “With the E5620, our team of lithography experts has created a superior tool that can handle today’s photomasks and is truly future-ready for the coming EUV generation.”
