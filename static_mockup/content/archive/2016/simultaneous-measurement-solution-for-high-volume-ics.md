# Simultaneous Measurement Solution for High-volume ICs

With market demand growing for price-sensitive ICs used in automotive, smart phone and other high-volume applications, conducting simultaneous measurements of multiple semiconductors has become vital to test cost reduction. Performing such highly parallel testing requires a performance board capable of handling the many circuit loads necessary for testing today’s most advanced analog devices.

Ideally suited to this requirement is Advantest’s new RECT550EX HIFIX (High-Fidelity Test Access Fixture),  which enhances the capabilities of its T2000 system-on-chip (SoC) test platform in performing highly parallel testing With  50 percent more application space and a capability of handling 30 percent more channels than its predecessor, highly parallel and simultaneous measurements can now easily be attained.

The T2000 platform is capable of accommodating several high-density test modules in the test head. The RECT550EX HIFIX enables the T2000 to take full advantage of these modules by allowing the system to be configured as needed for any device under test (DUT), including automotive semiconductors and power-management ICs. In addition, the new HIFIX unit maintains full compatibility with Advantest’s standard RECT550 HIFIX performance boards. When equipped with the RECT550EX HIFIX, the T2000 SoC tester can achieve an extremely low cost of test.
