# Advantest Announces Dates & Locations for VOICE 2017; Call for Papers Open through Nov. 18

Advantest has issued an international call for papers on semiconductor test solutions, best practices and innovative technologies for next year’s annual VOICE Developer Conference. The 2017 conference will again be held in two locations — Palm Springs, California, at the Hyatt Regency Indian Wells Resort & Spa on May 16-17, and VOICE will return to the growing China region with an event at the InterContinental Shanghai Pudong on May 26. Both conferences will feature the theme *Measure the Connected World and Everything in It.*

**As VOICE enters its second decade in 2017, the conference will continue to offer attendees comprehensive learning and networking opportunities including technical presentations focused on eight technology tracks, partners’ expositions and social gatherings. In addition, the VOICE Technology Kiosk Showcase will expand to include more interactive discussion sessions for users of Advantest’s V93000 and T2000 system-on-a-chip (SoC) test platforms, memory test systems, handlers, test cell solutions, product engineering and test technology.

For VOICE 2017, Advantest’s call for papers focuses on eight technology tracks:

**Hot Topics
