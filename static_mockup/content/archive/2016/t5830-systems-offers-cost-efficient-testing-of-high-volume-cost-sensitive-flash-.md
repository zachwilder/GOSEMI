# T5830 Systems Offers Cost-Efficient Testing of High-Volume, Cost-Sensitive Flash Memories

 

Advantest’s newest memory tester delivers full ATE capability and scalable performance to address the booming IoT and smart card markets. T5830 is the latest member of the T5800 product family, and is optimized for testing a wide range of flash memory devices used in mobile electronic devices. The highly flexible T5830 tester has all of the capabilities needed to perform wafer sorting and final testing of price-sensitive flash memories. It uses a scalable, built-in high-current programmable power supply (PPS) architecture that provides the flexibility and economic performance to handle low-pin-count to high-pin-count devices. The system also leverages Advantest’s innovative Tester-per-Site™ design. This allows each site to operate independently, enabling very fast test times and lowering the overall cost of test.

With an operating frequency of 400 MHz, the tester is capable of handling data transfer rates of up to 800 megabits per second (Mbps). In addition, the T5830 can handle up to 2,304 devices under test (DUTs) at one time when configured with four digital pins.

This new tester is ideally suited for handling a wide range of devices including NOR and NAND flash memories that use the standard serial peripheral interface (SPI) protocol, low-pin-count flash devices such as smart cards and single in-line memories (SIM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs) and other embedded flash devices.

The T5830 tester is available in both production and engineering models, making the system applicable for qualification testing as well as high-volume production. It is built on the same platform and uses the same FutureSuite™ software as all other members of the T5800 product line. This enhances the system’s reliability and provides modular upgradeability.
