# Advantest Postpones VOICE 2020 in Scottsdale to September 29-30

Advantest announced the postponement of its VOICE 2020 Developer Conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., due to health and safety concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The two-day conference will now take place September 29-30, 2020, with a Workshop Day on October 1. The Omni Scottsdale Resort & Spa at Montelucia in Scottsdale will remain the venue for VOICE 2020.

**VOICE Program Remains Unchanged**

Designed by test engineers for test engineers, the core of the VOICE Developer Conference remains its extensive learning and networking opportunities, including a [technical program](https://voice.advantest.com/scottsdale-technical-program/) featuring more than 60 presentations with submissions from authors representing 28 companies from 11 countries, a partners’ expo, a technology kiosk showcase, innovative keynote speakers and social gatherings as well as a full day of workshops.

The technical program will feature hot topics, including artificial intelligence (AI) and SmarTest 8 software, new tracks on DC parametric and 5G testing, as well as device/system-level test, test methodologies, hardware and software design integration and Advantest’s T2000 platform. The Workshop Day will consist of sessions covering 5G/mmWave, V93000 test program generation and power/analog device testing. In addition, a technology kiosk showcase at VOICE will offer attendees the opportunity to interact directly with Advantest product experts.
