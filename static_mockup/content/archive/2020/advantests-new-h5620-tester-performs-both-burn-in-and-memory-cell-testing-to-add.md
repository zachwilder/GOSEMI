# Advantest’s New H5620 Tester Performs Both Burn-in and Memory-cell Testing to Address the Rapidly Growing Demand for DDR DRAM Units

Advantest introduced its new versatile, high-throughput H5620 memory tester that combines the capabilities to perform both burn-in and memory-cell testing for advanced DRAMs and LPDDR (low-power, double-data-rate) devices.

With the advent of 5G technology, worldwide DRAM bit-based consumption is expected to approximately double by 2023.  This increase is being driven primarily by growth in the data-processing and mobile-communication market segments, with data centers requiring more memory and smart-phone functionality expanding to include higher resolution, foldable capability and multi-camera designs.  As the average selling prices for memory ICs continue to shrink, semiconductor manufacturers need ways to reduce testing costs while increasing production volumes.

Advantest’s newest tester helps to accomplish this with its superior efficiency.  In production environments, the H5620 can test over 18,000 devices in parallel at 100-MHz frequencies and data rates up to 200 Mbps.  It is adaptable for factory automation and supports a wide temperature range of -10° C to 150° C with a dual-chamber structure featuring individual thermal-control stability.

In addition, the new system can reduce customers’ capital expenditures and save floor space by combining legacy memory-cell testing with the burn-in test process in memory production facilities.

The H5620 runs on the FutureSuite™ operating system with its versatile tool set.  This software ensures that the tester can be easily integrated with legacy memory test systems from Advantest.  In addition, assistance with program coding, debugging, correlation and maintenance is available from Advantest’s global support network.

The new H5620 tester has begun shipping to customers and the H5620ES engineering model will be ready by the second quarter of this calendar year.
