# Advantest’s Inaugural Virtual Tradeshow Draws Nearly 200 Attendees from 47 Companies

Reacting swiftly to the cancellation of some of the industry’s most critical trade shows and gatherings, Advantest hosted a virtual tradeshow on March 10-11 to share valuable technical and market data with its customers worldwide without risking attendees’ exposure to potential illness from the coronavirus (COVID-19). 

Using web conferencing, technical experts from Advantest presented the newest semiconductor-testing technologies and best practices as well as interacted with strategic partners, and current and potential customers. The online forum also featured talks on the state of the industry and market outlook from two senior executives of SEMI, the global industry organization representing the electronics-manufacturing supply chain.

Advantest hosted its first virtual tradeshow with the goal of maintaining the flow of valuable technical, industry and market data among employees, customers and partners worldwide. Nearly 200 attendees representing 47 companies attended the informative, online sessions presented in multiple languages.

The success of this unique virtual tradeshow focusing on the semiconductor test industry shows the power of reacting quickly to changing market conditions to provide a valuable service to customers. The event addressed the industry’s information needs and provided opportunities for members of the global test community to interact with each other.

Recordings of the virtual tradeshow presentations are available until June 1.
