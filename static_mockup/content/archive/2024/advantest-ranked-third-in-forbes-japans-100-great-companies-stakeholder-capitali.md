# Advantest Ranked Third in Forbes JAPAN’s “100 Great Companies” Stakeholder Capitalism Ranking

By GO SEMI & Beyond Staff

In October, Advantest announced that it had earned third place in the stakeholder capitalism ranking published as a part of the “100 Great Companies” special feature in *Forbes JAPAN,* the Japanese edition of the global business magazine *Forbes* (December 2024 issue, published on October 24).

The “100 Great Companies” ranking was independently calculated by *Forbes JAPAN *with the cooperation of Sustainable Lab, which collected and analyzed sustainability-related data in five categories: natural capital, employees, shareholders, suppliers/communities, and customers/consumers. The analysis covered 1,644 companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Prime Market. Companies were scored on indicators in each of these categories, based on a relative evaluation of each industry, and the final score for each company was calculated by weighing the scores compared to the rest of the industry. 

Advantest defines sustainability as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations.

Advantest aims to be the most trusted and valued test solutions company in the semiconductor value chain. To achieve this vision, the company is committed to meeting the expectations and needs of its global stakeholders. Advantest strives to provide a balanced mix of economic and social values, contributing to global sustainable development while enhancing its corporate value in the medium to long term.
