# Advantest Ranks As THE BEST Assembly Test Equipment Supplier and the #1 Large Supplier of Chip Making Equipment in 2024 Customer Satisfaction Survey

In May, Advantest today announced it has once again received top ratings in the 2024 TechInsights *Customer Satisfaction Survey*, capturing the No. 1 spot on this prestigious annual survey of global semiconductor companies for the fifth consecutive year.

Advantest has been rated on the 10 BEST list for each of the 36 years that the survey has existed. The survey ratings are based on direct customer feedback representing more than 60% of the world’s chip producers, which include integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), fabless companies, and outsourced assembly and test (OSAT) providers. 

According to TechInsights, Advantest has been named THE BEST supplier of assembly test equipment this year and every year since 2020. The company also RANKED 1st for the fifth consecutive year in the 10 BEST list of large suppliers of chip making equipment and was the only company to receive a five-star rating. Worldwide participants rated equipment suppliers among 14 categories based on three key factors: supplier performance, customer service, and product performance. The categories span a set of criteria including cost of ownership, quality of results, field engineering support, trust, and partnership.  

In the 2024 survey, Advantest achieved high customer ratings in the areas of *Partnering*, *Recommended Supplier,* *Trust in Supplier*, *Technical Leadership, Commitment, Support After Sales, *and* Product Performance. *

The TechInsights annual Customer Satisfaction Survey is the only publicly available opportunity since 1988 for customers to provide feedback on suppliers of semiconductor equipment and subsystems. The 10 BEST, THE BEST, and RANKED 1st awards provide special recognition to suppliers rated highest by their customers. 

As a global provider of test solutions for SoC, logic and memory semiconductors, Advantest has long been the industry’s only ATE supplier to design and manufacture its own fully integrated suite of test-cell solutions comprising testers, handlers, device interfaces, and software – assuring the industry’s highest levels of integrity and compatibility.
