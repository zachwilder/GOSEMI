# Advantest Announces Advanced Power Multiplexer for V93000 EXA Scale Test Platform

 

**New PMUX02 Power MUX Features High Switch Density and Expanded Voltage Range to Optimize Test of High-Current Devices **

Earlier this month, Advantest announced a new power multiplexer developed specifically for use on the V93000 EXA Scale SoC test platform. The PMUX02 Power MUX offers unprecedented capabilities for multi-site testing of power and analog devices, including battery management system (BMS), automotive, and power management ICs. With 22 switches – nearly double the switch density of its predecessor – and an extended voltage range of ±160 volts (V), PMUX02 will help streamline and reduce cost-of-test for these high-pin-count, mixed-signal devices.

A power mux switches between multiple power sources and instruments to provide uninterrupted power and measurement to devices under test (DUTs). Electric vehicles (EVs) are a key driver behind the need for advanced power muxes. Increasing the number of cells stacked in an EV’s battery module improves its efficiency, and stacks of 24+ cells require the BMS to operate at 150V or higher. Moreover, as automotive ICs become increasingly complex with higher pin counts, more parallel sites are required to increase throughput, requiring more multiplexers. PMUX02 provides a denser array of relays in the test head and uses the system bus for communication, eliminating I2C driver circuitry and freeing up valuable loadboard space.

Up to 16 PMUX02 cards can be installed in an EXA Scale system; the exact number depends heavily on the specific customer application and site count. An optional air cooling kit is also available. PMUX02 is fully compatible with its predecessor, PMUX01, enabling customers to utilize the same loadboards for their applications. In addition, PMUX02 is integrated into Advantest’s SmarTest 8 control software environment and takes advantage of the same powerful routing tools as PMUX01—which is crucial for agile application development.
