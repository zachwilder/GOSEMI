# Advantest Expands Device Handler Offerings

In December, Advantest announced two new products designed to deliver advanced handling capabilities essential for the fast-growing artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) markets: the HA1200 die-level handler and the active thermal control (ATC) 2-kilowatt (kW) option for the M487x handler series. AI/HPC ICs require 2.5D/3D advanced packaging technologies to provide the high computing power necessary to generate, train and run data-intensive AI models. These ICs generate massive heat due to their high compute power, creating unique testing challenges. The new Advantest products are designed to address these challenges and help contribute to the AI/HPC market growth.

The **HA1200 die-level handler **for the [V93000 SoC test system](https://www.advantest.com/products/soc/v93000.html) tests singulated and/or partially assembled die. While 2.5D/3D packages enable high computing power by enabling minimum pattern length between die, stacking die can increase the risk of mixing good and bad die, leading to yield loss. Yield loss at final test, especially for 2.5D/3D packaged ICs, can cause good die, substrates, or interposers to be discarded. Equipped with Advantest’s HPC-proven ATC technology, the HA1200 enables testing powerful, high-performance SoCs with 100% test coverage. This helps reduce yield loss at final test, thus reducing loss of final multi-die assembled product.

The **ATC 2kW solution **for the M487x series ([M4171](https://www.advantest.com/products/test-handler/m4171.html), M4871ES and [M4872](https://www.advantest.com/products/soc/v93000/exa.html)) is designed to test AI/HPC IC packages at final test. The ATC 2kW solution features ultra-high-speed junction temperature (Tj) sensing and response technology to support high-performance ICs being tested at the set temperature and integrates Advantest’s unique force control technology to apply strong, stable, and safe contact to ICs with massive pin quantities. The ATC 2kW solution will support customers’ at-speed device test, enable safe 100% test coverage at final test while simultaneously increasing test quality and performance.
