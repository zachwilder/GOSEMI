# New TAS74000TS Measurement Solution Enables Materials Characterization for Beyond 5G

Advantest introduced a high frequency resolution option for its TAS7400TS terahertz optical sampling analysis system. It features excellent cost performance and ease of operation, and a new option that provides a groundbreaking measurement method for high-frequency characteristic evaluation of radio wave absorbers and base materials, which are indispensable for Beyond 5G / 6G next-generation communications technology and for the millimeter-wave radar technology used in ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems). 

Vector network analyzers (VNAs) have been widely used to evaluate the transmission characteristics (transmittance, reflectance) and complex permittivity of various materials in the millimeter-wave and high-frequency regions. But in recent years, it has become important to evaluate these characteristics over wider bandwidths, raising issues with VNAs on account of the time and effort required to set and calibrate each frequency band.

Advantest’s terahertz optical sampling system addresses these issues by enabling batch measurement over a wide band, utilizing pulsed electromagnetic waves. Measurements are now possible with a compact optical sampling system (measurement environment), saving on cost and space. It is also possible to analyze surface frequency characteristics with the mapping measurement option. Furthermore, the frequency resolution and scan speed of the new option are 5x that of the previous product, making this an optimal solution for evaluating the high frequency characteristics of new materials.

The solution will be exhibited at [JASIS](https://www.jasis.jp/en/), from November 8th to 10th, and at [MWE 2021](https://apmc-mwe.org/mwe2021/en_index.html), from November 24th to 26th.
