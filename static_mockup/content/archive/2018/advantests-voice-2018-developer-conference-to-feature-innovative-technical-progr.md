# Advantest’s VOICE 2018 Developer Conference to Feature Innovative Technical Program, Forward-Looking Keynotes and Interactive Kiosks in San Diego, CA and Hsinchu, Taiwan

Advantest will hold its 12th annual VOICE Developer Conference on May 15-16 in San Diego, California, and on May 23 in Hsinchu, Taiwan, to help members of the international semiconductor community improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of IC testing. These international gatherings present industry professionals with opportunities to hear more than 90 technical sessions on the latest test technologies and techniques, meet with experts, visit the Partners’ Expo, attend networking events and conduct in-depth discussions relating to a broad range of currently available IC test solutions.

The detailed VOICE 2018 technical program is available online at [https://voice.advantest.com/technical-program](https://voice.advantest.com/technical-program). This year’s program has been enhanced with fewer sessions running in parallel and will focus on timely topics in the automatic test equipment (ATE) industry such as hardware and software design integration, optimizing productivity, test methodologies, device-specific testing and – for the first time – the Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to paper presentations, Advantest R&amp;D engineers and technology experts will be available to discuss other testing topics with interested attendees during the Welcome Reception and Technology Kiosk Showcase.

The U.S. and Taiwan events will both feature engaging keynotes touching on artificial intelligence (AI). At VOICE in San Diego, Mike Walsh, CEO of Tomorrow, a global consultancy on designing companies for the 21st century, will present a keynote on “Reinventing Leadership for the Age of Machine Intelligence.”  The Taiwan event’s keynote speaker is Dr. Nicky Lu, chairman, CEO and founder of Etron Technology, Inc., who will address “Synergistic Growth of AI and Silicon Age 4.0 through Heterogeneous Integration of Technologies.” His presentation will be in Mandarin Chinese.

Managed by a steering committee of volunteer representatives from Advantest and its customers, VOICE is the leading conference for the growing international community of users and strategic partners involved with Advantest’s V93000 and T2000 SoC test platforms as well as Advantest memory testers, handlers and test cell solutions. The conference offers a unique opportunity to take part in making semiconductor testing operations as efficient and cost- effective as possible. Attendees gain and share valuable insights, build long-lasting relationships and learn what’s new about Advantest test equipment, handlers and applications.
