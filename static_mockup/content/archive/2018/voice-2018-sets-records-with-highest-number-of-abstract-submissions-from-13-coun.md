# VOICE 2018 Sets Records with Highest Number of Abstract Submissions from 13 Countries

Advantest’s VOICE 2018 Developer Conference returned to host cities of San Diego, CA, on May 15-16 and Hsinchu, Taiwan, on May 23, where successful VOICE events were held in 2016. The 2018 conference again set records, receiving 177 paper abstract submissions representing contributions from 13 countries. In addition to over 90 technical sessions, VOICE featured Partners’ Expos, highly rated keynote speakers, 25 technology [kiosks](https://voice.advantest.com/technology-kiosks/), and multiple networking opportunities. Altogether, 565 people attended the events, greater than 60 percent of whom represented Advantest customers and partners.

The San Diego event registered 276 attendees, the most of any U.S. VOICE Conference, and included 66 technical presentations, while the Taiwan conference featured 25 papers. Greater than 50 percent of the total papers across both locations were either written or co-authored by customers from 27 companies. The papers were reviewed by a technical committee that included 30 Advantest customers from 14 companies.

With expanded in-app voting capabilities, attendees selected the [best technical presentations](https://voice.advantest.com/best-paper-awards/) and, for the first time, the [best technology kiosk](https://voice.advantest.com/best-paper-awards/).
