The Advantest VOICE 2019 Developer Conference will be held in two new locations – Scottsdale, Arizona on May 14-15 and Singapore on May 23 – under the unifying theme “*Measure the Connected World and Everything in It *℠”. Online [registration](https://voice.advantest.com/register/) opens soon with a 20-percent discount offered for the Scottsdale event through March 8.

On May 15 at VOICE in Scottsdale, the program will begin with a [keynote](https://voice.advantest.com/keynotes/) speech by Dr. Wally Rhines, CEO emeritus of Mentor, a Siemens business, whose innovative electronic design automation (EDA) products and solutions help engineers conquer IC design challenges.
