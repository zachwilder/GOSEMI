## Lighting Up Hope with Expertise: A Volunteer Repair Mission in Guangfu, Hualien

On September 2025, a landslide dam breached in the Mataian River of Hualien, triggering massive floods and mudslides, devastating Guangfu Township, and bringing residents' daily lives to a standstill. To support post-disaster recovery, employees from Advantest Taiwan joined the "Fix & Chat" volunteer team, which traveled to Hualien from October 10 to 12, setting up a temporary repair station to provide free appliances and tool repair services.

Over the course of three days, the team repaired more than 50 damaged items, ranging from electric fans and rice cookers to refrigerators, washing machines, electric drills, circular saws, and cement mixers. Many of these machines were clogged with mud and rust after being submerged, making the repair process extremely challenging. Yet, through technical know-how and hands-on experience, the volunteers patiently disassembled, cleaned, and tested each device until they roared back to life.

Advantest employees were especially touched when residents came to retrieve their repaired appliances. Their smiles represented not just appreciation for restored belongings but the rekindling of hope in rebuilding their lives.

## Advantest Singapore Coastal Cleanup 2025: Teaming Up for the Ocean and the Community

On September 20, 2025, 59 Advantest volunteers gathered at East Coast Park Area G for Advantest Singapore's coastal cleanup event. Armed with gloves and tongs, the team picked up 13.09 kg of trash, including plastics, bottles, Styrofoam, and cigarette butts.

This event was part of the International Coastal Cleanup, a global movement that brings people together to protect our oceans and shorelines. This activity is also aligned with Advantest's commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 14 (Life Below Water), which focuses on maintaining a clean, healthy marine ecosystem.

After the cleanup, the group participated in a "Save the Ocean Animal" family game, where teams raced to catch balls representing endangered sea creatures, raising SGD1,500 worth of grocery items for the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH)---a meaningful way to give back to the community.

Last September, two groups of Advantest Test Solutions (ATS) employees (along with family members) volunteered at the nearby South County Outreach (SCO) Food Bank in Irvine, California. A total of 25 volunteers sorted through over 1000 lbs. (or 453 kgs) of food donations, some of which came from the ATS food drive held in mid-September. Both groups enjoyed the community outreach and the team-building experience while re-stocking and organizing the store shelves. ATS was also proud to have completed a successful food drive for SCO in the summer, a time when food donations is typically low.

ATS is a proud supporter of SCO, a non-profit organization providing resources and opportunities to the food-insecure, unhoused or financially challenged.
