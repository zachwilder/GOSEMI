We are pleased to announce that Advantest concluded another successful SEMICON West, held for the first time in Phoenix, Arizona, from October 7-9. This debut firmly positions Phoenix as a rising powerhouse of innovation and industry growth.

Advantest's booth attracted more attention than in previous years, with 270 visitors, many of whom were VIP customers. The booth featured the company's latest test solutions, including SiConic, the T5801 ultra-high-speed DRAM test system, the company's system-level test platforms, including the new 7038 Single Test Rack (STR), and its Silicon Photonics test solution. Advantest hosted nine press meetings and a successful customer hospitality event.

Advantest had a strong presence at the TestVision Symposium as well, presenting multiple papers and posters on a myriad of relevant topics, including advanced packaging, data analytics, the utilization of AI/ML in test, co-packaged optics and silicon photonics.

In addition, we are happy to congratulate Advantest America Applications Engineer Nasco Arseniev, who was named an awardee of SEMICON West's 20 Under 30 Award. This program is designed to recognize and uplift young professionals making a significant positive impact on the semiconductor industry.

SEMICON West 2026 will take place in San Francisco, California, as the conference continues its new rotation between Phoenix and San Francisco.
